    "Cancer in Indonesia from Indonesian sources: the national cancer plan for 2024 to 2034 and its six priority cancers, a cancer registry covering about 14 per cent of the population whose data have not yet passed IARC's quality bar, a national insurance scheme with about 285 million members that pays for cancer care on the national formulary, BPOM's 90-day reliance route, screening coverage of 14.6 per cent for cervical and 13.7 per cent for breast in 2023, and how few Indonesian sites appear in cancer trials.",
  lede:
    "Indonesia has a national cancer plan for 2024 to 2034 that concentrates on breast, cervical, lung, bowel, liver and childhood cancers, and a single public insurance scheme, run by BPJS Kesehatan, that covers about 98 per cent of the population and pays for treatment on the national medicines list. It does not yet have a national count of cancers: its registry covers about 14 per cent of the population, so the national figures are IARC's estimates.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Indonesia is 474,083 new cancers and 283,299 deaths, including 7,234 non-melanoma skin cancers (466,849 without them). IARC codes its Indonesian incidence method as 4 (national or subnational rates scaled to regional all-cancer rates) and its mortality method as 3c (incidence estimates applied to modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios), so neither figure is a count: no Indonesian registry has yet been accepted into Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. The national cancer plan quotes GLOBOCAN 2022 (408,661 cases and 242,099 deaths) as its headline. The registry's own figures, in the table above, are counts of registered cases in 26 districts and cities (about 14 per cent of the population) for 2008 to 2012 and 2013 to 2017, not national totals or rates, and cannot be compared directly with IARC's.",

The national cancer plan (Rencana Kanker Nasional 2024-2034) chose six priorities on this basis: breast, cervix, lung, colorectal, liver and cancers in children under 18. It reports that the registry's counts and BPJS Kesehatan's 2022 claims data show the same pattern, with breast cancer first in women and lung cancer first in men. The plan states that about 70 per cent of patients are already at an advanced stage when they begin treatment, and that BPJS Kesehatan's spending on cancer rose from 3.1 trillion rupiah in 2020 to 5.9 trillion in 2023, second only to heart disease.",

The ministry then set 26 districts and cities as the registry's area, with RS Kanker Dharmais as the national cancer data centre, and the 2008 to 2012 (Volume XI) and 2013 to 2017 (Volume XII) submissions also failed the quality criteria. The plan names the causes: no data transfer between the fourteen hospitals and district hospitals, passive reporting by private hospitals and laboratories, and staff turnover. It names the city of Yogyakarta, with the most complete data of eighteen priority areas, as the first candidate for Volume XIII; IARC's CI5 site lists volumes I to XII only.",

The plan's text lists adult leukaemia among the cancers where Indonesia lags, which its own chart does not show; the figures are given here as charted. In the BPJS Kesehatan cohort, survival was 95.4 per cent at one year, 64.9 per cent at three and 56.8 per cent at five.

It reported the share of accelerated authorisations rising from 70.6 per cent in 2024 to 87.5 per cent in 2026. From 2023 to the end of 2025 BPOM issued 12,111 medicine authorisations, 86.26 per cent for domestic products.
