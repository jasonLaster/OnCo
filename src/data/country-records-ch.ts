Since 2020 every Swiss cancer must by law be reported, with its stage and first treatment, and this office turns that into national figures, including how well breast and prostate cancer are being treated.",
    summary: "Adult cancer registration in Switzerland is cantonal: 13 cantonal registries record each new case in the population of the canton where the patient lives, and the Childhood Cancer Registry in Bern records those under 20. The NKRS does not register cases itself; it collects, checks, harmonises and analyses what the cantonal registries send, and passes the national dataset to the Federal Statistical Office, which publishes the annual cancer monitoring.\n\nThe office is run by the Foundation National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER), founded in Zurich in 2007 out of the Association of Swiss Cancer Registries of 1978, and mandated by the Federal Department of Home Affairs since 2018 under Article 33 of the Cancer Registration Act (KRG) and Article 36 of its ordinance. The Act, passed by Parliament in March 2016 and in force since 1 January 2020, introduced a duty to report, the AHV insurance number as the person identifier and a standard national dataset. Reports are due within four weeks; patients are informed and may object at any time, and data are registered no earlier than three months after the report so that a patient has time to decide.\n\nBecause the Act asks for diagnosis and first-treatment data, the NKRS now publishes care-quality indicators from the whole country: 38 indicators on more than 20,000 breast cancers and precursors from 2020 to 2022, and 32 on more than 35,000 prostate cancers from 2020 to 2023. In the prostate report, published in September 2026 with Swiss Urology, 76 percent of cancers were found by opportunistic PSA testing, the treatment decision was made at a tumour board in 56 percent of cases (85 percent in breast cancer), and 20 percent of men were on active surveillance; the report names avoidable overdiagnosis and overtreatment and recommends evaluating an organised early-detection programme.",

Reports for patients under 20 at diagnosis go to it rather than to a cantonal registry.\n\nThe Federal Statistical Office reports an average of about 252 new childhood cancers a year in 2018-2022, with deaths falling over time while registrations tend to rise, which the office attributes to a mix of better registration, changed diagnostic practice, chance variation in small numbers and a real increase.",

Rates are standardised to the 1976 European population, and the office publishes world-standardised rates too in its open data on the Swiss Stats Explorer.\n\nBecause registration was not national until the 2020 Act, the national figures are estimates: observed cases are weighted up by the share of the population covered by a registry, which the office's methods note gives as 55.3 percent in 1993-1997, 91.6 percent in 2013-2017 and 98.3 percent in 2018-2022. The French- and Italian-speaking cantons have been fully covered since 2006 and all German-speaking cantons since 2020.

For medicines the BAG applies them by listing a product on the Spezialitätenliste (SL), advised by the Federal Drugs Commission (Eidgenössische Arzneimittelkommission, KVV Article 37e). A product needs a valid Swissmedic authorisation (KVV Article 65), and its economic price is set half from a therapeutic cross-comparison with drugs for the same disease and half from the average price in nine reference countries: Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden (KVV Article 65b, KLV Article 34abis). The ordinances do not use a cost-per-QALY threshold.\n\nA company may file with the BAG once Swissmedic has confirmed the indication and dose in its preliminary decision, and where it does, KLV Article 31b says the BAG decides as a rule within 60 days of final authorisation. The industry association Interpharma calculated that in 2025 this happened for 4 percent of newly authorised medicines and that the median time from authorisation to SL listing was 219 days; that is an industry calculation from SL and Swissmedic data, not a BAG figure, and OnCo could not find the BAG's own measure.\n\nBefore a drug is listed, or for a use outside its label, insurers can pay case by case under KVV Articles 71a to 71d, after consulting their medical adviser, where a large therapeutic benefit is expected against a disease that can be fatal or cause severe chronic harm and there is no effective authorised alternative. The insurer must decide within two weeks of a complete request and must give reasons for a refusal to doctor and patient; the price is negotiated with the company at a discount of up to 50 percent on the reference price, depending on the benefit category.",

      "142,665 primary prostate cancers were registered between 1980 and 2021; 70.2 percent were in men aged 60 to 79.",
      "Incidence rose to 226.6 per 100,000 men by 2004, fell to 173.5 in 2011-2014, and rose again to 220.6 in 2021, mainly in localised, lower-grade cancers.",
      "Incidence of distant and stage IV cancer increased after 2011, while Gleason 8 to 10 cancers stayed stable.",
      "Mortality fell continuously from the early 1990s to 34.8 per 100,000 men in 2021; ten-year relative survival rose from 46.2 percent in 1982-1991 to 88.5 percent in 2012-2021, and 99.2 percent for localised cancer.",

    whatItMeans: "The authors read the pattern as more overdiagnosis of lower-risk cancer alongside a rise in advanced diagnoses, and see room to organise early detection better, the same conclusion the NKRS care-quality report reached.",

    summary: "A nationwide study, led from the Geneva Cancer Registry on the national dataset of the NKRS, of every adult diagnosed with a first colorectal adenocarcinoma in Switzerland from 1980 to 2021. Rates were standardised to the 1976 European population, trends estimated by joinpoint regression and five-year net survival by the Pohar-Perme method.",

      "Early-onset incidence rose steadily: annual percent change +0.46 in men and +0.49 in women, driven by rectal cancers and, in young women, proximal colon cancers; incidence in older adults declined after the mid-2000s.",
      "From 2010 to 2021, 27.7 percent of early-onset cancers were UICC stage IV, against 22.1 percent at ages 50-74 and 19.4 percent at 75 and over.",
