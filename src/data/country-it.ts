 * Italy deep dive: the hand-written cards and tables for /countries/it/. Plain English first, detail second, every
 * card with its sources. Entity lists are pulled from the graph on the page by id so they stay in step with the corpus.
 *
 * Written from Italian primary sources rather than from the corpus: the 2025 and 2024 editions of I numeri del cancro
 * in Italia (AIOM, AIRTUM, Fondazione AIOM, the Istituto Superiore di Sanità's PASSI surveillance, the national
 * screening observatory ONS and the pathologists' society SIAPeC-IAP), the text of law 29 of 2019 and of the 2025 budget
 * law on Normattiva, AIFA's own pages and determinations, the AIFA list of innovative medicines dated 30 September 2026,
 * and the sites of CNAO, AIRC and Alleanza Contro il Cancro. Every figure was read from the raw page or from
 * pdftotext output of the PDF, not from a summary of it.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind:
 *  - Italy's registries have published registered incidence up to 2017. The national "new cases" figure is therefore a
 *    projection: AIRTUM projected 360,000 to 390,000 for 2024 under two assumptions, and the 2025 edition did not
 *    produce a new one. Incidence excludes non-melanoma skin cancer.
 *  - Deaths are the 2022 estimates the 2025 edition prints; it says estimates for 2023 were not available.
 *  - GLOBOCAN's 436,242 for Italy in 2022 counts all cancers including non-melanoma skin (code 39), so it is not
 *    comparable with the AIRTUM figure.
 *  - The ClinicalTrials.gov counts in IT_TRIAL_STARTS are OnCo's own, made on 3 November 2026 with the API v2 query
 *    query.cond=cancer, query.locn=Italy, filter.advanced=AREA[StudyType]INTERVENTIONAL AND AREA[StartDate]RANGE[<year>],
 *    and the same with AND AREA[LeadSponsorClass]INDUSTRY for the industry column.

The 2025 edition reports that from 2013 to 2017 the registries monitored 44,459,587 inhabitants and recorded 1,648,162 new cases, that its projections run about 20,000 cases a year below IARC's, and that, pending registered data from 2018 onwards, 2025 was not expected to differ materially from 2024. It notes the Italian population fell 0.6 per cent between 2020 and 2025 and that, on IARC figures, the age-standardised incidence of all cancers except non-melanoma skin fell 10.1 per cent in men between 2004 and 2017 (315 to 286 per 100,000) and rose 4.4 per cent in women (228 to 238).",

AIFA classifies its managed entry agreements as outcome-based (payment by result, in which the company repays 100 per cent of treatment failures; risk sharing, a discount for non-responders only; and success fee, in which the service initially receives the medicine free and pays only for responders) or financial (cost sharing, a discount on the first cycles for everyone, and capping). The registries network spans about 3,500 health facilities, 52 regional leads, 963 medical directors, 32,857 doctors and 2,318 pharmacists, with 49 companies holding at least one registry. An innovative indication is automatically subject to a registry.",

    title: "The right to be forgotten: no need to declare a cured cancer after ten years, or five for childhood cancers",
    plain: "Since January 2024, Italians who have had cancer do not have to tell insurers, banks, employers or adoption services about it once ten years have passed since the end of treatment without relapse, or five years if they were diagnosed before 21. For some cancers the wait is shorter, as little as one year.",
    detail: "Law 193 of 2023, passed unanimously by both chambers and in force from 2 January 2024, bars asking for or using information about a past cancer in insurance, credit, employment competitions and adoption once ten years have passed since the end of treatment without recurrence (five years if diagnosed before age 21). A ministerial decree of 22 March 2024 set shorter terms: one year for stage I colorectal cancer, stage I to II breast cancer, testicular cancer and thyroid cancer in women diagnosed under 55 and men under 45 (excluding anaplastic); five years for endometrial cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma under 45 and acute leukaemias; six for melanoma and cervical cancer over 21; seven for stage II to III colorectal cancer over 21. A July 2024 decree created a free certificate issued by a family doctor or specialist. Writing in October 2025, Giordano Beretta and Elisabetta Iannelli of FAVO note that the labour ministry decree and the insurance and banking regulators' measures were still missing, and argue that an August 2024 decree requiring the certificate in adoption proceedings contradicts the law.",

    detail: "CNAO's history page dates the idea to a 1991 report by Ugo Amaldi and Giampiero Tosi, the design to the CERN PIMMS study, the funding decision to Umberto Veronesi as health minister in 2000, and the inauguration to 15 February 2010, at a construction cost of 135 million euros plus 37.1 million euros for the three years of clinical trials the ministry required. Its home page states that hadron therapy has been reimbursable by the national health service since 1 January 2014; its history page states that it entered the LEA in 2017. It treats tumours of the skull base, head and neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, limbs and spine and paediatric solid tumours, and does not treat widely metastatic disease.",

Bonadonna also introduced the ABVD chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.",
    detail: "Milan I randomised 701 women with tumours of 2 cm or less between 1973 and 1980; at twenty years, death from any cause was 41.7 per cent after quadrantectomy with radiotherapy and 41.2 per cent after radical mastectomy (New England Journal of Medicine 2002). Bonadonna's 1976 trial gave CMF after radical mastectomy for node-positive disease; after 27 months, 5.3 per cent of 207 treated women had relapsed against 24 per cent of 179 controls. The Milan criteria for liver transplantation in hepatocellular carcinoma came from the same institute's surgery department (Mazzaferro, New England Journal of Medicine 1996). Later Italian academic groups produced the APL0406 trial that cured acute promyelocytic leukaemia without chemotherapy (GIMEMA), the HERACLES trial of HER2-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer (Candiolo and Niguarda) and the SOUND trial that showed axillary surgery can be omitted in small breast cancers with a negative ultrasound (IEO).",

    detail: "Alleanza Contro il Cancro states that it was founded by the Ministry of Health in 2002 and that its members are 27 IRCCS, the patient association AIMaC, the Italian Sarcoma Group, the CNAO foundation, the nuclear physics institute INFN, the Fondazione Policlinico di Milano and the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, which hosts it. The health minister's preface to the 2025 edition names research funding through targeted research and IRCCS activities, and investment through the national recovery and resilience plan, as the ministry's levers. AIRC, the country's largest cancer charity, gave more than 141 million euros to research in 2024, of which more than 112 million funded 673 individual projects, 8 special programmes and 90 fellowships and 29 million went to its own institute IFOM, supporting about 5,200 researchers. A national lung screening network (RISP) of 18 centres in 15 regions, coordinated by the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, had performed about 9,130 baseline low-dose CT scans by May 2024.",

Second, whether the regulation under law 29 of 2019 that activates the national registry network has been adopted since September 2025: the Ministry of Health's site (salute.gov.it) refused every request with a 403 on 3 November 2026, so the Piano Oncologico Nazionale 2023-2027 is described here from the 2024 edition's account of it rather than from the plan itself. Third, the number of IRCCS recognised for oncology and the funding the ministry gives them, which the same site holds. Fourth, the regional oncology networks one by one: the 2024 edition reports a ministerial decree of 10 June 2024 rewarding regions whose networks are fully operational, but which regions qualify was not found in a primary source.",

Still missing: AIOM and its guidelines, AIRTUM as an institution, the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, the Italian cooperative groups GIM, GOIRC, GONO and MITO, Italian trials registered only in the EU registers, and the ABVD regimen's founding paper.
