  description:
    "Cancer in Poland from Polish sources: the national registry's 192,922 cancers registered in 2023 and 99,676 cancer deaths, a single public insurer that gives cancer medicines free of charge to the patient, the fast-track cancer card and the National Oncology Network, how the reimbursement act and the assessment agency decide what is paid for, emergency access to unreimbursed medicines, the screening programmes and their coverage, a new lung screening programme from October 2026, and a compensation fund for clinical trial participants.",
  lede:
    "Poland counts every cancer in one national registry, which recorded 192,922 new cancers in 2023, and lung cancer kills more Polish women than breast cancer. Its single public insurer gives cancer medicines free of charge to the patient, a cancer card sends a patient with a suspected cancer past the ordinary referral queue, and since April 2025 only hospitals in the new National Oncology Network may treat cancer under a public contract.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Poland is 202,797 new cancers and 114,190 deaths for 2024, labelled ICD-10 C00-97 and including 6,621 non-melanoma skin cancers (196,176 without them). The Polish National Cancer Registry's own count for 2023 is 192,922 cases, but it covers C00 to D09, so it includes 18,838 other skin cancers (C44) and 7,593 in situ tumours; its invasive cancers other than skin come to 166,491 by the registry's own tables. GLOBOCAN's like-for-like figure is therefore about 18% higher, which is consistent with the registry's own statement that its counts are burdened with some under-registration. On deaths, the registry's 99,676 is the count of 2023 death certificates from Statistics Poland, against GLOBOCAN's modelled 114,190 for 2024; neither source explains the gap of about 14,500, so it is noted here rather than explained. The registry standardises its rates to the world (Segi) and 2013 European populations: its world-standard incidence for 2023, 253.30 per 100,000, is close to GLOBOCAN's 255.75.",

Cancer was the second cause of death in Poland, causing 26% of deaths in men and 23% in women, and the bulletin estimates that 1.47 million people were living after a cancer diagnosis. In men the commonest registered cancers were prostate (24.5% of cases), lung (12.6%), large bowel (11.4%) and bladder (5.6%); in women breast (22.6%), lung (9.2%), large bowel (9.2%) and uterine body (6.8%). Lung cancer caused 25.4% of male cancer deaths and 18.6% of female ones: 8,602 women died of lung cancer against 6,757 of breast cancer, and the bulletin notes that more women have died of lung than of breast cancer for over a decade. It also records that cancer is especially important in women under 65, among whom it has been the most frequent cause of death for years, accounting for 45% of deaths of women aged 45 to 64.",

          detail:
            "The bulletin's summary states that the long-term trends in cancer incidence and mortality in Poland are shaped both by the age structure of the population and by changes in exposure to carcinogens, mainly cigarette smoking, and that in 2024 the share of men and women smoking became equal, with 21% of adults smoking cigarettes daily. For over twenty years lung cancer incidence and mortality in men have fallen, which the registry attributes primarily to the fall in male smoking. Prostate cancer shows the fastest growth in registered incidence, while its mortality, flat around the turn of the century, has tended upwards since 2014. Colorectal cancer, the third commonest in men, has shown a favourable trend in incidence and mortality since 2015. The years 2020 to 2022 were distorted by COVID-19 deaths (18.4% of male and 17.1% of female deaths in 2021), and in 2023 the share of deaths from infectious diseases returned to its pre-pandemic level.",

Cases are held in a central database, and nearly 180 hospitals have integrated their systems with the e-KRN system, which the registry says further improved completeness in 2023. It nonetheless calls its figures registered incidence because of remaining under-registration, and uses the ratio of deaths to cases by region as its simplest measure of completeness. In 2023, 96.2% of cases in men and 96.4% in women were confirmed by histopathology, with regional values from 89.4% to 99.9%.

  how:
    "Every card was written from Polish official sources read in Polish: the Polish National Cancer Registry's bulletin on 2023, the consolidated texts of the reimbursement act, the healthcare benefits act, the National Oncology Network act and its July 2026 amendment, the Medical Fund act, the clinical trials act and the National Oncology Strategy act and resolution, all through the Sejm's ELI service, the Minister of Health's screening regulations, the NFZ's screening coverage spreadsheets for 1 November 2026, the Ministry's summary of the 1 October 2026 reimbursement list, and the pages of the assessment agency, the Medical Research Agency and the government patient portal. Each figure was checked against the raw text of the PDF, spreadsheet or page rather than a summary. Trial counts come from OnCo's own ClinicalTrials.gov records. The new records added for this page are the registry, the NFZ, the assessment agency, the regulator and the Medical Research Agency.",
  verify:
    "Registered cases undercount some cancers, as the registry itself says. The reimbursement list changes every quarter and drug programme criteria are precise: before relying on whether a medicine is paid for, check the current list and its programme annex and ask the treating hospital. Paper cancer cards can be issued only until the end of 2026, and the lung screening programme only opened in October 2026.",
