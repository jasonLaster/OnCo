    "tldr": "BHV-1510 is an experimental chemotherapy-delivering antibody being studied alone and with immunotherapy. Early response findings need confirmation in larger trials.",
    "summary": "Biohaven reported an early combination cohort with cemiplimab at the October 10, 2025 cutoff: 23 efficacy-evaluable patients across doses had confirmed ORR 52.2%. A selected 2.5 mg/kg dose group had responses in 3/5 NSCLC, 4/4 endometrial and 1/2 urothelial patients. These very small, uncontrolled populations do not establish superiority over approved ADCs or isolate the ADC contribution from immunotherapy. NCT06384807 registers phase 1/2 testing and identifies PBI-410 and GQ1010 as alternative names.",
