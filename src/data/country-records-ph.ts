The breast package was raised from P100,000 by PhilHealth Circular 2024-0007, effective 30 March 2024, which allots 1,000,008 pesos of it to trastuzumab in three tranches of six cycles; PhilHealth said no co-payment applies in ward accommodation and 21 health facilities were contracted for the package in April 2024. Radiotherapy is paid at P3,900 a session with cobalt and P5,850 with a linear accelerator.\n\nPhilHealth Circular 2025-0014 added outpatient screening tests from 14 August 2025, requested by the member's registered primary care provider and paid at fixed rates with no co-payment: mammogram P2,610, breast ultrasound P1,350, low-dose chest CT P7,220, alpha-fetoprotein P1,230, liver ultrasound P960 and screening colonoscopy P23,640.
