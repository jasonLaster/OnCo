The plan concentrates on six cancers (breast, cervix, lung, colorectal, liver and cancers in children under 18) and sets out six strategies: promotion and prevention, screening and early detection, access to diagnosis and treatment through to palliative care, cancer registration and research, partnerships, and governance.\n\nThe ministry sets the Formularium Nasional, the list of medicines that the Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN) scheme run by BPJS Kesehatan pays for; the plan cites Keputusan Menteri Kesehatan HK.01.07/MENKES/2197/2023 as the current formulary. Its health technology assessment process (Penilaian Teknologi Kesehatan) advises on what enters the JKN benefit package; the plan lists completed cancer assessments including trastuzumab for early and metastatic breast cancer, bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer, rituximab for non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pembrolizumab for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nIt designates hospitals into a tiered cancer referral network (madya, utama and paripurna strata, under Keputusan Menteri Kesehatan HK.01.07/MENKES/1277/2024) and names RS Kanker Dharmais as the national cancer centre and the national cancer data centre for the cancer registry.",

The plan also states that the JKN benefit package does not yet cover many targeted and immunotherapy medicines recommended in Indonesian clinical guidelines, and cites a study at Cipto Mangunkusumo hospital in which 79 per cent of patients receiving radiotherapy under JKN reported financial toxicity.\n\nPresidential Regulation 59 of 2024 added fourteen screening services to the JKN benefit, among them screening for cervical, breast, bowel and lung cancer, and introduced a standard inpatient class (Kelas Rawat Inap Standar).\n\nThe coordinates on this record are a central Jakarta point, not the address of the head office.",

Submissions for 2008 to 2012 (Volume XI) and 2013 to 2017 (Volume XII) did not meet IARC's quality criteria and were not published. The plan names gaps in data transfer between the fourteen hospitals and district hospitals, passive reporting from private hospitals and laboratories, and staff turnover.\n\nThe plan sets eighteen priority districts and cities, names the city of Yogyakarta as having the most complete data and the first priority for reporting to Volume XIII, and plans to move registration onto the ministry's SATUSEHAT data platform. A separate paediatric registry, IP-CAR, recorded about 2,000 new childhood cancers in 2022 to 2023 against an estimated 10,000 a year.\n\nThe coordinates on this record are those of RS Kanker Dharmais, which hosts the data centre.",
