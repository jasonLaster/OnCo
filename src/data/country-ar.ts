    "Cancer in Argentina from Argentine sources: 59,537 cancer deaths counted in 2024 and IARC's estimate of 139,470 new cancers, the national childhood cancer registry, three health subsystems and the rule that insurers pay the full cost of cancer medicines under approved protocols, PAMI and the public drug bank for people with only public cover, the health technology commission CONETEC, how ANMAT registers medicines already approved abroad, the screening programmes and their uptake, the childhood cancer law, and 446 trials in OnCo with a site in Argentina.",
  lede:
    "Argentina counts every cancer death, 59,537 in 2024, but has no national count of new cancers: the Ministry of Health uses IARC's estimate of 139,470 for 2024, built from provincial registries. The national insurance package obliges social insurers and prepaid plans to pay the whole cost of cancer medicines given under approved protocols, and a public drug bank supplies them to people who rely on public hospitals alone.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Argentina is 139,470 new cancers (133,448 without non-melanoma skin cancer) and 71,570 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 215.5 per 100,000 and mortality of 99.7. Argentina has no national count of new cancers to set against it: the Ministry of Health's own incidence page quotes the GLOBOCAN figure, and its 2024 mortality report notes that IARC's incidence depends on the population-based registries whose data meet the standard for Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, last published in 2024 with data for 2013 to 2017. IARC's fact sheet gives the incidence source as sub-national registries and the method as national mortality estimates applied to modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Deaths can be compared. The Ministry counted 59,537 deaths from malignant tumours (C00 to C97) among residents in 2024, from death certificates, against GLOBOCAN's 71,570, about 20% more. IARC's fact sheet describes its mortality for Argentina as national WHO data with trends projected to 2024, so it is a projection rather than a count; the sources read do not explain the size of the gap, so it is stated here, not explained. The gap is wide for lung cancer, 8,369 deaths counted against 10,892 estimated.",

Cancer was the third cause of death overall, but the first cause of death from illness between the ages of 5 and 59, and the death rate has fallen over the last ten years.",
          detail:
            "The Ministry of Health's surveillance system, SIVER-Ca, counted 59,537 deaths from malignant tumours (C00 to C97) in 2024 from the death certificates the provinces send to the national health statistics directorate, 29,607 in men and 29,930 in women; 76.2% were in people aged 60 and over. Counting all tumours (C00 to D48), the 62,427 deaths were 16.7% of the 374,636 deaths in the country, after cardiovascular (28.0%) and respiratory disease (20.6%). By site, lung cancer caused 8,369 deaths (14.1%), colorectal cancer 7,455 (12.5%), breast cancer 5,912 (5,817 of them women, 19.4% of cancer deaths in women), pancreas 4,365 and prostate 3,483. From 2014 to 2024 the age-standardised cancer death rate fell from 123.97 to 97.79 per 100,000 in men (an annual change of -2.3%) and from 88.93 to 78.25 in women (-1.3%), both statistically significant. Lung cancer mortality in men fell 36% over the same decade, breast cancer mortality 14% and prostate cancer mortality 26%. The report notes that less than 10% of deaths in Argentina are recorded with an ill-defined or unknown cause.",

In 2024 men in Tierra del Fuego had a cancer death rate about 40% above the national figure, and women in Santa Cruz about 20% above it, while Santiago del Estero and Tucumán had some of the lowest rates. The Ministry reads such differences partly as unequal access to early diagnosis and treatment.",

Tierra del Fuego, Santa Cruz and Neuquén had the highest rates in men, Tierra del Fuego about 40% above the national average at 148.9; Santiago del Estero had the lowest in men (66.1). In women, Santa Cruz was highest (105.5, about 20% above the national average) and Tucumán among the lowest (68.6). The report says that earlier SIVER-Ca reports showed falling cancer mortality with important differences by tumour and province, which suggests inequalities in access to early diagnosis and treatment. In the Sur region, which groups the Patagonian provinces, tumours were 24.3% of all deaths in 2024, against 14.4% in the north-west. The Ministry's mortality page itself gives 8,378 and 8,371 for 2024 lung cancer deaths in different paragraphs; the report's table gives 8,369, used here.",

Its 2025 book gives an incidence of 131.0 cancers a year per million children under 15 for 2000 to 2022, stable over the period, and estimates that its average of 1,358 cases a year is about 92% of the 1,484 expected at the average rate of the International Incidence of Childhood Cancer series. Leukaemias are the commonest, then central nervous system tumours and lymphomas. Five-year survival for 2010 to 2019 was 70.3% (ten-year 67.7%): 70.7% for leukaemias, 60.9% for central nervous system tumours, 84.5% for lymphomas, 92.9% for retinoblastoma and 52.3% for bone tumours. Five-year survival rose from 59.7% for children diagnosed in 2000 to 2004 to 70.9% for 2015 to 2019. In 2013 to 2022, 76% were treated in public hospitals and 45% of public hospital cases in two reference centres; in 2018 to 2022, 48% moved to another province at some point.

The same page lists ten population-based registries, nine provincial (Tucumán, Santa Fe, Chaco, Entre Ríos, San Luis, Tierra del Fuego, Mendoza, Neuquén and Córdoba) and one for the district of General Pueyrredón in Buenos Aires province, started between 2001 and 2022, with stated covered populations adding up to 15,738,789, about a third of the 45.6 million people counted in the 2022 census.

Item 7.4 adds 100% coverage of supportive medication to prevent and treat vomiting caused by anticancer drugs and of pain medication for cancer patients, both according to approved protocols, and item 7.5 gives 100% coverage, financed by the solidarity redistribution fund, to medicines on specific lists of the then special programmes administration.

Amendments to Decree 150/92 after the ordered text ANMAT publishes, including any made since 2023, were not read. How a newly registered cancer medicine becomes part of an insurer's obligations, beyond the general rule of Resolution 310/2004, was not traced. Which cancer medicines are on the SURGE reimbursement annexes and the amounts were not read. CONETEC's list of published assessments is loaded by a script and was not read, so no cancer assessment is cited. The text of ANMAT Disposition 4008/17 was not read; the trial authorisation times come from the ANMAT staff poster.",

        "The Ministry's legislation pages (argentina.gob.ar/normativa) returned server errors, and the live Boletín Oficial timed out, so Decrees 459/2025 and 344/2023 were read from Internet Archive copies and Resolutions 731/2023, 201/2002 and 623/2018 from Ministry of Health copies. The page of the Ministry's Dirección de Asistencia Directa por Situaciones Especiales returned not found, so what it offers is not described. IARC's CanScreen5 fact sheets for Argentina load by script. PAMI's plan page carries, in markup that is not displayed, figures on the share of people in cancer treatment who are its members; because the page does not show them, they are not used. No national survey of screening uptake later than 2018 was found, and SITAM's own figures were not published on the pages read. The Banco de Drogas list read is a file created in March 2023; whether a newer list exists was not established.",

    "Every card was written from Argentine official sources read in Spanish: the Ministry of Health's report on cancer mortality in 2024 and its incidence and mortality pages, the childhood cancer registry's 2025 book, Decree 459/2025, the 2022 census volume on health coverage, the resolutions that set the national package of care, the prepaid medicine law, the Superintendencia's resolution creating SURGE, PAMI's pages, the Banco de Drogas page and its medicine list, Decree 344/2023 and CONETEC's pages, ANMAT's ordered text of Decree 150/92 and its pages, an ANMAT staff analysis of trial authorisation times, the national screening programmes' pages, the 2018 National Risk Factor Survey and the page on Law 27.674. Each figure was checked against the raw text of the PDF or page rather than a summary. GLOBOCAN figures come from IARC's 2024 data and fact sheet. Trial counts come from OnCo's own ClinicalTrials.gov records. The new records added for this page are ANMAT, the Superintendencia, PAMI, CONETEC, the childhood cancer registry and the Hospital Garrahan.",
  verify:
    "Incidence on this page is IARC's estimate, not a count. Coverage of a cancer medicine depends on whether you have an obra social, a prepaid plan, PAMI or public cover alone, and on the protocol and list in force: before relying on it, ask the insurer or the treating hospital, and for the drug bank, check the current list. The national cancer institute became a directorate of the Ministry in 2025, so older documents use its former name.",
