 * Canada deep dive: the hand-written cards and the one hand-built table for /countries/ca/. Plain English first,
 * detail second, every card with its sources. Entity lists are pulled from the graph on the page by id so they stay
 * in step with the corpus.
 *
 * Written from Canadian primary sources rather than from the corpus: the Canadian Cancer Statistics publications of
 * the Canadian Cancer Society, Statistics Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada (the 2025 full report and the
 * 2026 projections published in CMAJ), Statistics Canada's own description of the Canadian Cancer Registry, Health
 * Canada's guidance on priority review, Notice of Compliance with conditions and Project Orbis, the Council of the
 * Federation's page on the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance, INESSS's own pages (in French), the Canadian Cancer
 * Trials Group's 2025 annual report, the Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network and the Canadian Partnership Against
 * Cancer. Canada's Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) answered every scripted request with a browser challenge, so its process is
 * described through peer-reviewed analyses of its decisions, each named; that is listed as a gap at the end.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind:
 *  - Canadian Cancer Statistics standardise rates to the 2021 Canadian population from the 2025 edition onward; they
 *    are not comparable with earlier editions or with GLOBOCAN's world-standard rates.
 *  - National incidence leaves out Quebec from 2018 and Nova Scotia from 2020 or 2021 in different products, because
 *    those provinces' cases had not reached the Canadian Cancer Registry; the cards say which product excludes what.
 *  - "All cancers" in the Canadian figures excludes non-melanoma skin cancer and includes in situ bladder cancer.

Lung, breast, prostate and bowel cancer together make up 47 per cent of new diagnoses, and 42 per cent of people in Canada are expected to be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives.",

Breast follows at 32,700 cases, prostate at 29,300 and colorectal at 25,300; pancreatic cancer, eleventh by cases at 7,500, is projected to be the third leading cause of cancer death at 6,500, behind lung and colorectal. The age-standardised incidence rate for all cancers is 591.4 per 100,000 and the mortality rate 200.0, both on the 2021 Canadian standard population and both projected to fall; the incidence rate is 16 per cent higher in males (642.2 against 553.9) and the mortality rate 36 per cent higher (235.8 against 172.8). The release adds that cancer caused about one in four deaths in Canada in 2023 and remains the leading cause of death. In the 2025 report, 93 per cent of new cases in males and 87 per cent in females were expected in people aged 50 and over.",

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death in both sexes. The same release notes that many provinces have now started lung cancer screening programmes at various stages of implementation. Colorectal cancer runs the other way: it is projected to be 32 per cent lower in males and 29 per cent lower in females than in the early 2000s, and the 2025 report attributes part of the decline since 2011 to organised colorectal screening, which Yukon and every province except Quebec introduced between 2007 and 2016.",

Among the provinces studied, five-year survival for all cancers is highest in Ontario (64 per cent) and lowest in Nova Scotia (61 per cent).

Mortality follows the same gradient: lower in the western provinces and Ontario, higher in Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.

    detail: "The 2025 report explains that its incidence data run to 2021 but that 2020 was excluded from projections because the pandemic disrupted screening and diagnosis, so incidence projections rest on data to 2019; Quebec's cases diagnosed from 2018 onward had not been submitted to the Canadian Cancer Registry at the time of analysis, so Quebec was projected from 2017, and Nova Scotia's data were available only to 2019. Lifetime-probability tables therefore cover Canada excluding Quebec and Nova Scotia, and survival covers Canada excluding Quebec. The 2026 cancer-specific table labels its case projections \"based on data to 2019\" and its death projections \"based on data to 2022\", while the CMAJ abstract says registry data were used \"until 2022\". The article's methods explain the difference: incidence data from 1997 to 2022, with 2020 left out, were used for every jurisdiction except Quebec and Nova Scotia, whose cases diagnosed after 2017 and after 2019 respectively had not reached the registry, so the table's label appears to describe only part of the data.

Statistics Canada adds that Quebec's registry changed its sources in 2011 to 2013, adding pathology reports and then local hospital cancer registries to the hospital-discharge data it had relied on, so Quebec counts before 2011 are underestimates, most for prostate cancer and melanoma.",

A study of 88 cancer indications approved between 2003 and 2014 in nine provinces found that after pCODR began the median time from Health Canada's Notice of Compliance to provincial funding fell from 522 to 393 days, and that agreement between provinces on what to fund rose (a Brennan-Prediger coefficient of 0.54 before and 0.78 after).

Canada publishes no fixed cost-per-QALY threshold of the kind England's NICE uses.",

    detail: "A 2025 brief report examined the nine cancer drugs granted a Notice of Compliance with conditions between 1 January 2023 and 31 December 2024. Three of them had received provincial listings (glofitamab, niraparib with abiraterone, and epcoritamab), with a median of 509 days from licence to first provincial listing (interquartile range 306 to 544). Epcoritamab was the only one to take the new time-limited recommendation and temporary access route; compared with glofitamab, which has a similar profile and took the ordinary route, it reached its first listing more than 200 days sooner. The authors found that the gain came from the alliance processing the file in parallel with the review rather than afterwards, not from either agency reviewing faster; CDA-AMC review times for all three fell within its target of 180 days or less. When the report was written a second drug had been announced as entering the route: a new indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan, whose conditional licence and the alliance's letter of intent were both dated 17 January 2025.",

The 2022 review in Current Oncology says the Quebec process is modified to consider \"societal factors\", that \"in Quebec, individual citizens can also submit their feedback to INESSS\", and that the province has \"a more generous and separately adjudicated individual patient review program, which may provide access to medicines that are rejected by INESSS.\" Quebec still joins the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance for price negotiation.",

Submissions filed for advance consideration under the Notice of Compliance with conditions policy have a review target of 200 calendar days plus 10 days processing and 25 days screening; the guidance explains that the longer target reflects the limited data on which such licences are often based.

Eligible products are new active substances or new indications in oncology that meet the FDA's priority review criteria and qualify for Health Canada's priority review or advance consideration for a conditional licence. Three collaboration types exist: Type A when the sponsor files with a partner within 30 days of the FDA, Type B when later, and Type C when the FDA has already approved and shares its completed review. Health Canada states that its service standards do not change for Orbis submissions, though it may decide faster, and that each partner decides independently. A 2024 analysis in Lancet Oncology found 81 of 244 FDA cancer approvals between May 2019 and November 2023 went through Orbis; of the 49 reviewed by CADTH, 44 were conditionally recommended, and CADTH's median time from approval to decision rose to 202 days in 2023.",
