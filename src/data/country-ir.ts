    "Cancer in Iran from Iranian sources: the national population-based cancer registry's 124,833 registered cancers in 2016 against IARC's 156,467 estimated for 2024, public insurers that since 2014 aim to cap a patient's share of a hospital bill at 10%, a fund for special and hard-to-treat diseases in which cancer is among the costliest conditions, a regulator whose approvals of new cancer medicines trail the United States by about six years on average, free bowel and breast early detection in primary care, the antibody copies Iran makes for itself under sanctions, and opium as a cancer cause.",
  lede:
    "Iran counts its cancers through a national population-based registry run by its universities of medical sciences, which registered 124,833 new cancers in 2016; IARC estimates 156,467 for 2024. Public insurers, after a 2014 reform, aim to cap what a patient pays for a hospital stay at a tenth of the bill, and Iranian companies now make their own versions of the cancer antibodies trastuzumab, bevacizumab, pertuzumab and rituximab, under sanctions that Iranian cancer specialists link to shortages and delays.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Iran is 156,467 new cancers and 97,732 deaths. IARC labels the all-cancers figure ICD-10 C00-97, and it includes 4,242 non-melanoma skin cancers (152,225 without them). IARC's incidence method for Iran is national rates applied to the 2024 population; its death figure is not a count of deaths but is derived from the incidence estimate through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. The latest national registry report OnCo could read in full is for 2016: 124,833 new cancers registered, of which 12,136 were non-melanoma skin cancers, nearly three times IARC's skin figure, so that without them the registry's sex tables give 111,672. Both standardise to the world population: the registry's all-cancers rate for 2016 was 177.48 per 100,000 against GLOBOCAN's 146.88 for 2024, and the two differ by eight years and in how skin cancer is counted. The registry covered 30 of 31 provinces (98% of the population) in its first national report, for 2014.",

Rates were highest in the north-west and centre of the country and lowest in Sistan and Baluchistan.",

Age-standardised incidence (Segi world population) was 192.96 per 100,000 in men and 162.33 in women, or 170.50 and 148.43 without non-melanoma skin cancer, which the authors note is below the world rates of 206.9 and 178.1. Median age at diagnosis was 64 in men and 57 in women. West Azarbaijan had the highest rate in men and Yazd in women. The paper's headline total of 124,833 and the sum of its sex tables, 123,807, differ by 1,026, which it does not explain. In the registry's first national report, for 2014, 112,131 cancers were registered and the order in men was stomach, prostate and colorectum, so prostate cancer moved to first place in men between the two reports.",

The 2016 analysis describes it as managed by all 60 medical universities under the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, following IARC and International Association of Cancer Registries protocols, coding tumours in ICD-O-3 and registering by place of residence; about 30,679 patients without a national identity number were matched on name, father's name, birth date and sex. Researchers describe the registry's annual reports as publicly available, and peer-reviewed studies have used them up to diagnosis year 2018. The 2016 authors note the registry holds no information on mortality, survival or recurrence. A 2023 study linked records from SEPAS, Iran's integrated electronic health record, to find about 197,164 cancer patients for the registry.",

A 2024 study of the registry's annual reports counted 19,679 gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 from 2014 to 2018 and found the rate of early-onset colorectal cancer rising (age-standardised 3.07 per 100,000 over the period), while early-onset oesophageal cancer fell and early-onset stomach cancer held steady; Golestan had the highest rate of early-onset oesophageal cancer. A spatial analysis of 482,229 cancers registered from 2014 to 2017 identified the northern and north-western regions as high-risk areas for stomach cancer in both sexes and for lung cancer in men.",

At one Tabriz hospital, a study of 1,778 people admitted with lung cancer from 2010 to 2017 found the patient's share of hospital costs fell from 22.16% before the plan to 10.5% after it, while the cost of admissions rose. A 2021 scoping review of 137 studies found mostly positive effects on satisfaction and hospital performance but different, contradictory and sometimes negative results for financial protection and informal payments.",

A 2025 study used the health ministry's death registration system for spatial analysis of cancer deaths from 2017 to 2019, but its counts fall sharply from 2017 to 2018 and do not read as complete national totals, so OnCo did not use them. National five-year survival figures were not found either. Both would need the ministry's own statistics, which could not be reached.",

    "Every card was written from Iranian sources or peer-reviewed studies of Iran. Iranian government websites did not answer on 4 November 2026, so the health ministry, the regulator, the main insurer, the Social Security Organization, the trial registry and the two antibody makers were read in Persian from dated Internet Archive copies of their own pages, raw. The national cancer registry's figures come from its published reports for 2014 and 2016, whose DOIs were resolved through Europe PMC; the 2016 tables were read from the open-access full text. Trial details were read from the ClinicalTrials.gov API, GLOBOCAN figures from OnCo's copy of IARC's 2024 estimates, and research counts from OnCo's OpenAlex file.",
  verify:
    "Registry figures are counts for 2014 and 2016, not current estimates; GLOBOCAN's 2024 figures are modelled and its death figure is derived from incidence. Insurance rules, the hard-to-treat diseases package and medicine availability change often and were read from archived pages up to five years old. Before relying on whether a medicine is available or covered, ask the treating hospital's pharmacy and the patient's insurer.",
