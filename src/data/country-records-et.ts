Its Integrated National Cancer Control Plan 2025 to 2029, led by the Disease Prevention and Control Lead Executive Office and the NCD desk and informed by an IAEA, WHO and IARC imPACT Review mission in November 2023, sets the goal of reducing premature cancer mortality by 15% by 2029 and prioritises breast, cervical and childhood cancers. It is costed at about 141.0 million US dollars over five years. The coordinates on this record are an approximate Addis Ababa city point.\n\nThe plan reports that comprehensive cancer treatment centres grew from 1 to 7, that 30 hospitals now give breast cancer chemotherapy, that clinical oncologists grew from 3 or 4 to over 50, and that cervical screening has reached more than 1,500 public facilities and over 1 million women aged 30 to 49. In February 2022 the Ministry opened Ethiopia's second radiotherapy centre, at Jimma University Hospital, and said seven more were being built.\n\nThe Ministry led the 2019 revision of the essential health services package, which ranked 1,018 interventions using seven criteria including cost-effectiveness and financial risk protection, and the plan records that the package lists 70 interventions for neoplastic conditions. The national essential medicines list (6th edition, 2020) includes 54 essential cancer medicines.",

It covers the city's ten sub-cities. The coordinates on this record are those of the hospital campus, approximately.\n\nIts first published data, for 2012 and 2013, counted 4,139 new cancers, two thirds in women. Its 2018 to 2022 report counted 14,053 cancers in a population of about 3.7 million (2020), roughly 3% of Ethiopians, with breast cancer (38.8%) and cervical cancer (14.3%) together just over half of cancers in women, and colorectal cancer the commonest in men. The Ministry of Health's 2025 to 2029 plan calls it the foundation for a national registry, says the registry depends on donors, and plans population-based registries at all five university-affiliated cancer treatment centres. The imPACT reviewers of November 2023 recommended complete coverage of the city so that its data could be accepted in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, absorbing its staff into Ministry structures, and making cancer a notifiable disease by law.",

In July 2025 its news page reported the Health Minister giving 63 million beneficiaries in 13.67 million households for the 2017 Ethiopian fiscal year. In August 2025 a consultant presenting for the service said community-based insurance covers 80% of citizens and social health insurance for the formal sector will cover the remaining 20%; beside 65 million members in a population he put at over 115 million (about 57%), the 80% reads as the share the scheme is meant for, not the share enrolled. The Ministry of Health's cancer plan for 2025 to 2029 records that members can use all services available at government facilities, but that because services are often unavailable there, 60 to 70% of member families still pay out of pocket, including for medicines bought privately.",
