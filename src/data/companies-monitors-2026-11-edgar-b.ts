    summary: "Starton Holdings, Inc., with principal executive offices and a laboratory in Paramus, New Jersey, filed a registration statement for its initial public offering with the SEC in 2026, with the Nasdaq symbol STA applied for. The filing describes a clinical-stage company whose platform delivers approved, off-patent medicines continuously, by ambulatory subcutaneous pump, oral controlled-release tablet or transdermal patch, to lower peak blood levels and improve tolerability, and says it is focused first on blood cancers.\n\nIts lead programme STAR-LLD is continuous low-dose lenalidomide, the active ingredient of Revlimid, developed as a subcutaneous formulation (STAR-LLD-SC) and an oral controlled-release formulation (STAR-LLD-OCR) in parallel. The filing states that Phase 1 and 1b studies of STAR-LLD-SC in multiple myeloma are complete and that a Phase 2a study in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma is under way; it also describes planned investigator-initiated trials with CAR-T cell therapies and T-cell engagers, the first with elranatamab supplied by Pfizer. A transdermal olanzapine patch for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is on hold. The company's operating subsidiary, Starton Therapeutics, is the sponsor of the registered trial NCT06087653.",
