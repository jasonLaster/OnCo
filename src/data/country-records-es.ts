Spain has no single national incidence count: the registries cover defined regions, and the national figures are estimates built from them. Its 2026 incidence report, published in January 2026, used the twelve consolidated registries covering all ages (Asturias, Gran Canaria and Tenerife, Castellón, the province of Salamanca, Euskadi, Girona, Granada, La Rioja, Mallorca, Murcia, Navarra and Tarragona) together with national mortality data from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística, and projected 301,884 new cancers for 2026, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer.\n\nIts third survival report, published on 3 December 2025, included 813,661 cancers in adults diagnosed from 2003 to 2017 in twelve registries covering 25% of the Spanish population; age-standardised five-year net survival for those diagnosed in 2013 to 2017 was 57.4% in men and 65.2% in women. The network also publishes estimates for haematological neoplasms and works with the Spanish childhood tumour registry.\n\nThe network's website gives no single registered seat; the coordinates on this record are a country centroid, not an address.",

    summary: "Published as \"The hospital exemption pathway for the approval of advanced therapy medicinal products: an underused opportunity? The case of the CAR-T ARI-0001\". The authors, from Hospital Clínic de Barcelona's Advanced Therapies Unit, describe how in February 2021 the advanced therapy medicinal product ARI-0001 (CART19-BE-01), developed at the hospital, received authorisation from the AEMPS under the hospital exemption pathway for patients aged over 25 with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The hospital exemption, foreseen in the European regulation on advanced therapies, allows access to products prepared on a non-routine basis, to quality standards, for an individual patient, limited to the member state where the product was developed and used in a hospital under a medical practitioner's responsibility. Such products must meet national traceability, pharmacovigilance and quality requirements.",
    findings: [
      "ARI-0001 was authorised by the AEMPS under the hospital exemption in February 2021 for patients aged over 25 with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",
      "Use under the hospital exemption is limited to the member state where the product was developed, in a hospital, under the responsibility of a medical practitioner.",
      "The authors argue the route offers close contact with clinical practice, the quality and rapid access patients need, and lower cost than a regular marketing authorisation, while barriers remain because member states implement it differently.",
    ],
    whatItMeans: "Spain's use of the hospital exemption is a working model for public hospitals making cell therapies at lower cost; the paper is the account of how it was done by the people who did it.",

A population-based study within REDECAN using data from 15 cancer registries included every new cancer diagnosed in people aged 20 to 49 between 1993 and 2018, 153,599 cases, 58% of them in women.
