 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind while reading the numbers below:
 *  - incidence  NKR, diagnoses in 2025, preliminary, released 4 February 2026. Includes squamous cell carcinoma of
 *               the skin (ranked first) and, from this release, low-grade central nervous system tumours; excludes
 *               basal cell carcinoma of the skin.
 *  - deaths     "ruim 46.000 in 2024" as quoted by IKNL in its October 2026 projections release.
 *  - survival   NKR relative survival by stage for diagnoses in 2020-2024, released 30 June 2026.
 *  - GLOBOCAN   the table on the page is the modelled GLOBOCAN 2022 estimate used across the site, for comparison
 *               with other countries; it is not the registry's count.

    title: "About 135,000 new cancers a year, with skin cancer counted first",
    plain: "In 2025, 134,800 people in the Netherlands were told they had cancer, about the same as the year before. The most common was squamous cell skin cancer, then prostate, breast, lung and bowel. Around 46,000 people died of cancer in 2024, and about a million people alive today had a cancer diagnosis in the previous twenty years.",
    detail: "IKNL's World Cancer Day release gives 134,800 diagnoses in 2025 (72,100 men and 62,700 women) against 134,700 in 2024, marked as preliminary. Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin was the commonest diagnosis, followed by prostate, breast, lung and bowel; IKNL's head of registration, Otto Visser, attributes the steep rise in prostate cancer mainly to an ageing population and partly to changes in how it is detected, and the rise in skin squamous cell carcinoma to the growing number of people over 75. The total is higher than in earlier releases because low-grade tumours of the central nervous system, which the World Health Organization now classes as malignant, are counted for the first time; basal cell carcinoma of the skin is left out, as is usual. The same release says about one million people are alive who were diagnosed in the previous twenty years. IKNL's projections, published in October 2026, put deaths from cancer at 'ruim 46.000' (just over 46,000) in 2024, and expect diagnoses to rise from just over 136,000 in 2025 to almost 170,000 in 2045 (about 23 per cent) and deaths by 24 per cent to just over 57,000, mainly because the population is ageing; once growth and ageing are allowed for, the average risk of a diagnosis stays roughly level. Note the two releases give slightly different 2025 totals (134,800 preliminary in February, 'ruim 136.000' in October); the page quotes each as its source does.",

    detail: "Diagnoses of bowel cancer fell from 13,000 in 2013, the year before screening began, to 11,300 in 2025 (6,000 men and 5,300 women). Cancers that had already reached the lymph nodes, liver or other organs at diagnosis fell from 7,200 in 2013 to 5,900 in 2024; the 2025 figure was not yet available. IKNL describes a rise in 2014 and 2015 as screening was phased in, then a fall, interrupted during the COVID-19 period, with the full target group of 55 to 75 year olds reached in 2019. A February 2026 OECD and European Commission comparison, as summarised by IKNL, put the Netherlands among the leaders in bowel screening participation, above the European target, but noted that breast and cervical screening participation had fallen since COVID-19 and that death within 30 days of emergency bowel cancer surgery is much higher than after planned surgery.",

    detail: "IKNL's June 2026 release gives five-year relative survival of 71 per cent, up from 48 per cent thirty years earlier, rising by 0.5 to 1 per cent a year. For tumours with a TNM stage diagnosed in 2020 to 2024 (excluding lymphoma), five-year survival was 93 per cent at stage I (80 per cent in 1990 to 1994), 80 per cent at stage II (70), 56 per cent at stage III (30) and 22 per cent at stage IV (13). The release's own text later gives stage III as 57 per cent in 2020 to 2024 and stage IV as rising from 18 per cent in 2010 to 2014 to 25 per cent in 2020 to 2024, a different grouping; OnCo quotes the bullet list in the table below and notes the discrepancy rather than choosing. For lymphoma, staged by Ann Arbor, survival was 87, 88, 77 and 66 per cent at stages I to IV. Survival above 90 per cent includes melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, testicular cancer and tumours of the meninges, cranial nerves and pituitary; below 10 per cent includes pancreatic cancer and cancer of unknown primary. IKNL warns that better detection of spread over the decades moves patients into higher stages and can make survival per stage look better than it is.",

It is not filled in by doctors: IKNL's own trained data managers go into each hospital and read the medical record. It records the diagnosis, the stage, how the cancer was found and the first treatment, and links to death records.",
    detail: "IKNL describes the registry as population-based and clinical-epidemiological, following every person with cancer from diagnosis to death regardless of hospital or treatment. Hospitals give authorised IKNL staff access to the record and the staff register the hospital, the tumour and its stage, how it was diagnosed, treatment, date of birth and sex; name and address are replaced by a code after registration and are kept only to link records across hospitals and to deaths in the national population register (BRP). There is also a link to Palga, the national pathology archive. The legal basis is scientific research and statistics in the public interest, so individual consent is not asked, but patients may object and have their data removed. IKNL stresses that the registry is not a quality registry: it does not rate hospitals against indicators, which is what the clinical audits do. Data from 1989 onward are national; survival data for 1961 to 1988 come from a growing number of hospitals around Eindhoven and, in the 1980s, from the north-west and south-east. IKNL is a non-profit foundation funded by a subsidy from the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport, and says it does not hold the registry on behalf of the hospitals.",

    detail: "First, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is counted and is the commonest cancer in the 2025 release, while basal cell carcinoma, the commonest skin cancer of all, is excluded from the totals because it so rarely kills; IKNL publishes basal cell figures separately from 2017. Second, from the February 2026 release IKNL counts low-grade tumours of the central nervous system, which the WHO reclassified as malignant, so totals rose relative to earlier releases for a reason that is not a change in disease. Third, the most recent year is preliminary: the 2025 total of 134,800 is marked as such. Stage is recorded under the TNM edition in force at the time (from the 4th edition in 1989 to the 8th from 2017), so stage-specific trends cross edition changes. GLOBOCAN 2022, which the table on this page uses for comparison with other countries, estimates 132,319 new cancers and 49,790 deaths in the Netherlands for 2022; read it as a modelled estimate on its own conventions, not as the registry.",

    plain: "Everyone who lives or works in the Netherlands must buy health insurance, and every policy covers the same basic package, which the government sets on advice from the Zorginstituut. Adults pay the first €385 of covered care each year themselves; hospital cancer care counts towards it, a GP visit does not.",
    detail: "The Zorginstituut describes its main task as composing the basic package of the compulsory health insurance; insurers sell the policies and contract the hospitals. The compulsory deductible (verplicht eigen risico) for 2026 is €385 for everyone aged 18 and over, payable once the insured person uses care from the basic package; care from the GP, maternity care, chain care and care for children under 18 are among the exceptions. A patient starting cancer treatment therefore usually reaches the deductible early in the year, after which the insurer pays for basic-package care for the rest of that calendar year. Where a separate personal contribution (eigen bijdrage) applies, it is paid on top. Expensive medicines given in hospital are paid as 'add-on' medicines, declared separately from the hospital's treatment tariff: IKNL defines them as hospital medicines costing on average more than €1,000 per patient per year.",

    detail: "The 2024 framework for cost-effectiveness, in use since reference values were introduced in 2015, sets the maximum extra cost per quality-adjusted life year by disease burden measured by proportional shortfall, the share of a person's remaining health that the illness takes away, from 0 to 1: a burden of 0.10 to 0.40 has a reference value of up to €20,000, 0.41 to 0.70 up to €50,000 and 0.71 to 1.00 up to €80,000. The framework says the value is an upper bound, 'not a target value', and that a manufacturer pricing a medicine exactly at the reference value would capture all of the surplus that society could otherwise share through a lower price. It also says that when a manufacturer already has several indications reimbursed, or a patent has been extended by a change with little clinical value, it may be better to start from an estimate of the manufacturer's costs than from the reference values, a question it records as unresolved. Reimbursement rests on four package criteria: necessity, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and feasibility, with the Scientific Advisory Board (WAR) judging the evidence and the Package Advisory Committee (ACP) weighing it against other patients' claims and all premium payers.",

    title: "The lock: an approved cancer drug can wait outside the package until its price comes down",
    plain: "A new hospital drug that is expensive enough can be held out of the basic package after European approval, in what the Dutch call the 'sluis' (the lock), until the Zorginstituut has assessed it and the ministry has negotiated a lower price, usually in confidence. Many recent cancer drugs have waited there.",
    detail: "Under rules set in law, a hospital medicine becomes a candidate for the lock if it is expected to cost €20 million or more a year across its new indications, or €10 million or more a year for one indication at €50,000 or more per patient per year. The lock was introduced in 2015 in response to expensive new hospital medicines straining hospital budgets. After the Zorginstituut's advice, the ministry's Bureau Financiële Arrangementen Geneesmiddelen (BFAG) may negotiate the price, and the minister decides; the medicine leaves the lock only once the price is agreed and there are agreements on appropriate use. In 2026 the Zorginstituut advised that durvalumab with platinum and etoposide for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer could be reimbursed only after a price cut of at least 60 per cent; after an agreement with the supplier it has been reimbursed since 29 August 2026. In September 2026 it advised that trastuzumab deruxtecan for HER2-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer needed a cut of at least 53 per cent. The list of medicines in the lock on the day this page was checked included, among others, abemaciclib, acalabrutinib for mantle cell lymphoma, amivantamab, axicabtagene ciloleucel, belzutifan, brexucabtagene autoleucel, capivasertib, carfilzomib, ciltacabtagene autoleucel, darolutamide with docetaxel, datopotamab deruxtecan for cervical cancer, durvalumab in several indications and epcoritamab.

    detail: "IKNL's key figures on expensive medicines, built from the Zorginstituut's GIP database of insurers' claims for add-on medicines and last updated in July 2024, show that use of immunotherapy and targeted therapy rose by 77 per cent between 2017 and 2022 and that spending on them doubled from €652 million in 2017 to €1.35 billion in 2021, then did not rise further in 2022 even though use did. Spending for non-small-cell lung cancer rose by almost 116 per cent from 2018 to more than €372 million in 2022; multiple myeloma was next at more than €251 million in 2022, 45 per cent above 2018. Haematological spending fell in 2022 because the patent on lenalidomide expired. All of these figures are at list price, excluding confidential discounts. Separately, IKNL found in June 2026 that after gene-expression tests such as MammaPrint and Oncotype DX became fully reimbursed for early breast cancer in October 2023, use among eligible patients rose from 9 to 37 per cent, so that about two in three eligible patients still did not have one; 52 per cent of eligible patients without a test received chemotherapy.",

Because the treatment had no marketing authorisation, it could be given only under a hospital exemption granted each year by the Health and Youth Care Inspectorate (IGJ), with the cells made in the Netherlands by the Netherlands Cancer Institute or Sanquin. The Netherlands Cancer Institute applied to the EMA in early 2025. No new hospital exemption was granted from 15 January 2026, so the treatment could no longer be given in the Netherlands and reimbursement stopped; the CHMP gave a negative opinion in June 2026 and, according to the Zorginstituut, the EU refused the authorisation on 14 September 2026. The Zorginstituut expects this to remain the case in the near future.",

    plain: "Instead of letting doctors prescribe a drug outside its licence case by case, the Netherlands runs it as a national trial. In DRUP, patients with no standard options left whose tumour carries a targetable change get an approved drug, every result is recorded, and the cohorts that work can make the case for payment. The Drug Access Protocol extends the idea to drugs that are licensed but not yet reimbursed.",
    detail: "The Drug Rediscovery Protocol (NCT02925234), led by the Netherlands Cancer Institute since August 2016, matches patients through a molecular tumour board to commercially available targeted drugs and immunotherapies contributed by companies, in cohorts defined by drug, tumour type and variant, with a fresh biopsy for whole-genome sequencing; its first report in Nature in 2019 found clinical benefit in 34 per cent of 215 treated patients and 63 per cent in a cohort of microsatellite-unstable tumours given nivolumab. The Drug Access Protocol, described in a 2026 Acta Oncologica study as a programme developed by oncologists, insurers and the Zorginstituut, links access to tumour-agnostic precision medicines authorised by the EMA on single-arm evidence to the collection of real-world outcomes; companies interviewed cited patient access and real-world data as reasons to take part and a lack of transparency among the challenges.",

Its 2019 Nature analysis of 2,520 metastatic tumour and normal pairs found whole-genome duplication in 56 per cent, 96 per cent of driver mutations clonal, and a variant that could direct treatment to an approved or trial drug in 62 per cent of patients.

For adults, SONCOS, the multidisciplinary oncology foundation of the medical specialist societies, has revised its standards report every year since 2012; version 14 (2026) requires, per location per year, at least 75 oncological oesophageal and gastric resections and at least 50 pancreatic resections, and at least 200 and 150 new patients discussed in the respective multidisciplinary meetings of a reference centre.

Breast: women aged 50 to 75 are invited every two years, usually to a mobile unit, with two X-rays of each breast read by two doctors; because of staff shortages there can currently be up to about three years between invitations. Cervical: people aged 30 to 60 are invited at 30, 35, 40, 50 and 60, and in some cases also at 45, 55 or 65, for an HPV test taken either by the GP or with a self-sampling kit at home, because cervical cancer takes 10 to 15 years to develop; about 900 people a year get cervical cancer and about 200 die of it.
