  description:
    "Cancer in Türkiye from Turkish sources: the Ministry of Health's registry count of 223,087 new cancers in 2019 and 195,581 in 2020, a population-based registry that has run in all 81 provinces since 2013, a single public insurer whose rules charge no additional fee for cancer treatment, how the Social Security Institution decides which cancer medicines it pays for and makes confidential reimbursement agreements, the national regulator's 210-day licensing clock and its 90-day reliance route, breast, cervical and bowel screening through 318 screening centres, and the national HPV test programme that screened its first four million women.",
  lede:
    "Türkiye counts its cancers through a Ministry of Health registry that collects cases in every province, and its latest published report puts the country at 195,581 new cancers in 2020, a year the pandemic kept many people from being diagnosed. One public insurer pays for cancer care under a single communiqué that bars extra charges for chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and the national cervical screening programme tests for the human papillomavirus at a single visit.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Türkiye is 235,949 new cancers and 113,805 deaths for 2024, including 7,554 non-melanoma skin cancers (228,395 without them). IARC built the incidence figure from subnational registry rates applied to the 2024 population, which in practice means the Ministry's provincial registries, and derived the mortality figure from incidence through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios rather than from Turkish death certificates. The Ministry's own report counts cancers coded C00 to C96 including the other skin cancers (C44): 223,087 in 2019, or 203,389 without the 19,698 other skin cancers, and 195,581 in 2020 (182,984 without them). Those figures come from the 14 provinces whose data pass quality checks, 50.4% of the population in 2019 and 50.6% in 2020, scaled to the national population with crude rates. The Ministry's world-standardised rate for 2019 was 229.2 per 100,000 for both sexes, above GLOBOCAN's 206.0 for 2024, which also includes non-melanoma skin cancer. Leaving aside the other skin cancers, the two differ most for lung cancer (GLOBOCAN 37,846; registry 31,742 in 2019) and thyroid cancer (18,291 against 13,891), and the registry's 2020 figures are about 13% below 2019 because diagnoses fell during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In women breast cancer is the commonest, about one in four of women's cancers, followed by thyroid, bowel, lung and womb cancer.",

            "The Türkiye Kanser İstatistikleri 2020 report, prepared by the cancer department of the General Directorate of Public Health and published in Ankara in 2025, gives a world-standardised incidence of 233.6 per 100,000 men and 162.8 per 100,000 women in 2020, and 198.2 for both sexes, against 264.9, 193.4 and 229.2 in 2019. The five commonest cancers in men in 2020 by standardised rate were lung (51.9 per 100,000), prostate (28.1), colorectal (24.1), bladder (19.1) and stomach (12.7); in women breast (43.4), thyroid (14.0), colorectal (13.3), lung (10.2) and uterine body (9.4). The report states that 30,004 people were diagnosed with lung cancer in 2020, that smoking-related cancers, above all lung cancer, are still very high in men, and that lung cancer incidence is rising in women. Thyroid cancer fell by 31% between 2019 and 2020 against about 13% for all cancers, which the report links to the pandemic, as SEER saw in the United States. Childhood leukaemias are the commonest childhood cancers, followed by lymphomas and central nervous system tumours, and childhood cancer incidence did not fall in 2020.",

The national figures come from the 14 provinces whose data pass quality checks, covering about half the population, and the latest year published is 2020.",
          detail:
            "Cancer was made a notifiable disease in 1982, and active registration began with the İzmir cancer registry centre in 1992, then Antalya six years later. According to the 2020 report, population coverage in the national report was 23.4% until 2012, 47.9% after Gaziantep, Malatya, İstanbul and Mersin were added, and 50.6% in 2020 with 14 provinces after Kocaeli joined in 2016; active registration had started in all 81 provinces from the 2013 reference year. Certified cancer registry staff collect data from every public, university and private hospital in a province, from laboratories, death certificates and places such as nursing homes and palliative care centres, and send them to the registry centre at the provincial health directorate and then to the cancer department, which removes duplicates and builds the national data pool. Quality figures for 2020: 91.8% of cases were histologically verified and 3.3% were known from a death certificate only; 40.9% of 2020 cases had been registered within 12 months of the year's end and 70.9% within 24 months, against international targets of 90% and 95%.

          detail:
            "The 2020 report gives SEER summary stage at diagnosis for the commonest cancers: 59.0% of lung cancers had distant metastases, which the report notes means lung cancer is usually diagnosed late; 45.5% of breast cancers were localised; 62.3% of cervical cancers were localised; and 58.9% of ovarian cancers were at a distant stage. For 2019 the same report series gave 54.9% of lung cancers with distant metastases, 48.3% of breast cancers localised and 54.9% of cervical cancers localised. Stage was unknown for 28.9% of the cases in the 2020 database, so these shares describe the cancers whose stage was recorded. The report publishes incidence, not survival; Türkiye's population survival figures appear instead in the international CONCORD-3 study, which used data from nine Turkish registries (Ankara, Antalya, Bursa, Edirne, Erzurum, Eskişehir, İzmir, Samsun and Trabzon).",
