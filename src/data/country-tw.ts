Among them, only lung, pancreatic and ovarian cancer had higher age-standardised death rates than in 2024.

            "The National Health Insurance Administration published the operating rules for the cancer medicine temporary payment fund (癌症新藥暫時性支付專款) on 25 February 2025. They cover cancer medicines or new indications with a Taiwanese licence and clear evidence of benefit that the global budget has not yet listed, and other cases the administration judges necessary. In April 2025 its drug-listing committee agreed to use the fund to widen pembrolizumab to first-line non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, first-line MSI-high or mismatch-repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer and early triple-negative breast cancer, and atezolizumab in first-line lung cancer, for about 3,400 patients at an estimated NT$3.295 billion a year before the companies' repayments under their payment agreements. Selumetinib for children with plexiform neurofibromas and elranatamab and teclistamab for myeloma after four lines of treatment were also paid from it. In May 2025 the administration held a workshop with England's NICE on its Cancer Drugs Fund and managed access agreements, to refine Taiwan's fund. Since 2023 it has also paid temporarily for medicines given accelerated approval, and since January 2024 companies can apply for reimbursement while the TFDA is still reviewing the licence, with a target of listing within six months of the licence for qualifying medicines.",

ClinicalTrials.gov names AstraZeneca as lead sponsor of 124 and Merck Sharp & Dohme of 84; non-small cell lung cancer is the first-listed cancer for 174, then prostate (52), hormone receptor-positive breast (42), colorectal (34) and liver cancer (33). Taiwanese sites took part in liver cancer trials including IMbrave150, HIMALAYA, REFLECT and EMERALD-1, the EGFR lung cancer trials LUX-Lung 3, FLAURA, ADAURA and LAURA, and JUPITER-02 in nasopharyngeal cancer, which lists three countries. Of the 36 Taiwan-only trials, 17 are phase 1/2, and their sponsors include TaiRx, AP Biosciences, Anbogen, OBI Pharma, InnoPharmax and Ever Supreme; the National Health Research Institutes sponsor one in biliary tract cancer, and National Taiwan University Hospital is testing surgery of the primary tumour in oligometastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The CDE reports that 83 of the 147 new trial protocols it reviewed in 2025 outside the abridged route for multinational multicentre trials (56%) were for cancer.",
