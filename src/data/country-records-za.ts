Since 1986 it has counted every cancer confirmed by a laboratory, and since 2017 it has also run registries that count every cancer, however diagnosed, in Ekurhuleni and, since 2023, in KwaZulu-Natal.",
    summary: "The National Cancer Registry is a division of the National Health Laboratory Service, run from 1 Modderfontein Road, Sandringham, Johannesburg, and published through the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Since 1986 it has run pathology-based registration: public and private laboratories send it every cancer diagnosed by histology, cytology or bone marrow, and it publishes counts and rates by sex, age and population group each year. Its tables for cancers diagnosed in 2024, posted in April 2026, count 48,865 cancers in women and 42,770 in men, including basal and squamous cell skin cancers; the rates for all cancers exclude those skin cancers and are 110 per 100,000 for women and 115 for men, age-standardised to the world population.\n\nRegulation R. 380 under the National Health Act, gazetted on 26 April 2011, established the registry in law under the control of the chief executive of the National Health Laboratory Service and made cancer reportable: a health establishment that confirms a diagnosis must submit a notification within three months, and laboratories must report quarterly. The regulation allows population-based registration to be introduced incrementally. The Ekurhuleni Population-Based Cancer Registry began collecting in January 2017 and counted 4,914 new cancers in 2024; the KwaZulu-Natal registry, run with the University of KwaZulu-Natal's Cancer and Infectious Diseases Epidemiology Research Unit since 2023, counted 3,923 in eThekwini. A separate childhood cancer registry counted 3,032 cancers in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe registry also runs the South African HIV Cancer Match Study, which links its records to the laboratory service's HIV test results. Its Ekurhuleni report for 2024 records that a cyberattack on the National Health Laboratory Service and a new patient identification system delayed case confirmation, so the 2024 total likely modestly underestimates true incidence, while its discussion adds that part of the 2024 rise reflects back-capture of records missed in 2023 rather than a true increase.

Because one laboratory service holds most public HIV tests, the registry and its partners linked those records to cancer diagnoses in the South African HIV Cancer Match Study: 5,222,827 people living with HIV with 29,580 cancers diagnosed in 2004 to 2014.

    summary: "The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority was established in 2018 as a Schedule 3A public entity and took over from the Medicines Control Council, inheriting a backlog of registration applications; its 2024/25 Annual Performance Plan states that the backlogs have been cleared. A study of approvals in 2020 found that approval timelines in its backlog stream, reviewed through facilitated pathways such as abridged and verification review, were 68 per cent quicker for new chemical entities and generics alike; business-as-usual applications all had a full review.\n\nIts reliance guideline, SAHPGL-BAU-01 version 4 of May 2024, sets out three routes: an abridged review based mainly on full assessment reports from a recognised regulatory authority, a verified review that checks a product against one already approved, and recognition of another authority's decision under a recognition agreement, which the guideline says SAHPRA was still negotiating. To qualify, a medicine must have been approved by one of the authorities SAHPRA recognises: the European Union's centralised and decentralised procedures, Health Canada, the UK's MHRA, Japan's PMDA, Swissmedic, Australia's TGA, the US FDA, or a WHO-listed authority. SAHPRA remains responsible for its decisions.\n\nThe 2024/25 plan sets targets of 80 per cent of new chemical entity applications finalised within 360 working days in 2024/25, 320 in 2025/26 and 300 in 2026/27, and 75 per cent of generic applications within 250 working days. It records that SAHPRA obtained the World Health Organization's maturity level 3 in 2022/23, describing a stable, well-functioning regulatory system for vaccines, aims for level 4, was designated a Regional Centre of Regulatory Excellence for vaccines in August 2023, and has run a priority review policy since 2021/22 for medicines that meet an unmet need or treat life-threatening conditions.

Its annual report for 2025/26 records 70 registered schemes (16 open and 54 restricted), 36 administrators and about 9.17 million beneficiaries in 2024, up from about 9.13 million in 2023, against a statutory solvency minimum of 25 per cent that the industry exceeded at 40.87 per cent.

The council's consumer guide says schemes must pay for these in full, without a co-payment or deductible, provided the member uses the scheme's designated provider, formulary and protocols.

It records as not approved, for example, pemetrexed for lung cancer and mesothelioma, temozolomide for glioblastoma, and rituximab for indolent lymphoma, which it deemed unaffordable at its current price. Trastuzumab for HER2-positive early breast cancer has been on the list since 2017, cut to six months in December 2019, and on 4 June 2026 the committee approved giving it before surgery and for locally advanced disease. New items are to be sourced on a national quotation, where possible, until a national tender is in place.

Its Breast Cancer Prevention and Control Policy of 2017 sets clinical breast examination twice a year for women over 40 attending primary care and reserves mammography for symptomatic and high-risk women, stating that screening mammography should not be introduced unless at least 70 per cent of women aged 50 and older could be reliably screened.\n\nThe National Health Insurance Act 20 of 2023, assented to on 15 May 2024, creates a National Health Insurance Fund to purchase care for users.

    summary: "The South African HIV Cancer Match study links HIV-related laboratory records from the National Health Laboratory Service with cancer diagnoses from the National Cancer Registry for 2004 to 2014. The authors included people with HIV-related tests on separate days and modelled cancer incidence as a function of age with natural splines.",
    findings: [
      "5,222,827 people living with HIV had 29,580 incident cancers, most often cervical cancer (7,418), Kaposi sarcoma (6,380) and breast cancer (2,748).",
      "At age 40 the commonest cancer was cervical cancer in women and Kaposi sarcoma in men; Kaposi sarcoma rates in men peaked at age 34 (101 per 100,000 person-years).",
      "Infection-unrelated cancers overtook infection-related ones after age 54; in older men prostate cancer became the commonest.",
    ],
    whatItMeans: "As people with HIV in South Africa live longer on treatment, screening and early detection for cancers not caused by infection matter more, while cervical cancer control stays essential.",
    caveats: ["Only cancers confirmed by a laboratory are in the registry.", "Data end in 2014, before universal treatment was fully rolled out."],

    tldr: "Of nearly half a million cancers recorded by South Africa's national registry from 2004 to 2021, only 41 per cent had a documented HIV status; among those that did, three in four people with infection-related cancers were living with HIV.",
    summary: "The authors used natural language processing on free-text pathology reports and probabilistic record linkage to match cancers diagnosed in public laboratories between 2004 and 2021, recorded in the National Cancer Registry, to HIV-related tests in the National Health Laboratory Service's data warehouse, and assigned HIV status from the tests and their timing relative to diagnosis.",
    findings: [
      "Of 496,517 cancers, 203,937 (41%) had a documented HIV status, rising from 29% in 2004 to 2009 to 52% in 2016 to 2021.",
      "Among cancers with a documented status, HIV prevalence was 75% for infection-related and 32% for infection-unrelated cancers.",
      "Documentation was more likely for women and for infection-related cancers, and less likely in population groups other than Black Africans.",
    ],
    whatItMeans: "Many people diagnosed with cancer in South Africa are living with HIV, which affects their treatment, but registry records often do not say so; the authors call on clinicians and pathologists to record HIV status at diagnosis.",

    tldr: "After South Africa's medicines regulator replaced the Medicines Control Council in 2018, approval timelines for its backlog applications, reviewed by relying on other regulators' work, were 68 per cent quicker.",
    summary: "The study compared the approval timelines achieved by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority in 2020 with those of the former Medicines Control Council, using a questionnaire completed and verified by the regulator and data on new chemical entities and generics registered in 2020 in its business-as-usual and backlog streams.",

      "All business-as-usual applications for new chemical entities and generics received a full, independent scientific review.",
