Its own press note of 30 June 2023 records that it first approved Yuhan's lazertinib (Leclaza), the 31st new drug developed in Korea, on 18 January 2021 for EGFR T790M-positive lung cancer after a previous EGFR inhibitor, more than three years before the United States approved it, and extended it to first-line treatment on 30 June 2023.\n\nIts annual trial statistics for 2025, published on 6 March 2026, count 783 approved drug trials (747 in 2024), of which 668 were company-led and 115 investigator-led. Cancer medicines accounted for 304 (276 in 2024), about 68 per cent of them (207) targeted agents. Multinational trials rose from 372 to 425, while trials of medicines developed by Korean companies fell from 305 to 259. Its note for 2024 cites an analysis by the Korea National Enterprise for Clinical Trials ranking Korea sixth among countries and Seoul second among cities, after Beijing, for new company-led trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov.\n\nA revised new-drug review procedure started in January 2025, with a dedicated review team for each product and early inspection of manufacturing; trade press reported that it came with a fee of 410 million won per new drug application and a target of 295 days against an average of about 420.

    summary: "HIRA reviews what providers bill to the National Health Insurance and assesses whether medicines, procedures and devices should be covered by it. Its English pages describe the drug route: a company with an MFDS-approved drug applies for coverage, HIRA's Pharmaceutical Benefit Assessment Committee assesses clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and the price of a newly listed drug is then negotiated between the company and the National Health Insurance Service. Cancer drugs are first considered by HIRA's cancer disease deliberation committee (암질환심의위원회), which sets the criteria for when a drug is reimbursed.\n\nHIRA's detailed evaluation rules state that it uses no explicit cost-effectiveness threshold, judging each case against earlier decisions in the light of severity, burden of disease, quality of life and innovation; an amendment in August 2024 wrote down three conditions, all of which must be met, for a new drug to be judged innovative enough for flexible treatment of its ratio. Each December HIRA publishes the range of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios it accepted over the previous five years. As reported by the trade press, anticancer drugs evaluated in 2019 to 2023 had a median of 39.93 million won per quality-adjusted life year and a maximum of 47.92 million won, and those evaluated in 2020 to 2024 a median of 42.94 million won and a maximum of 55.36 million won, the first time the maximum in the series HIRA has published since 2022 passed 50 million won.",
