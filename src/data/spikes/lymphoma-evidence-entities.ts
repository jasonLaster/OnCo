/**
 * LYMPHOMA: THE EVIDENCE FOR THE ENTITY PAGES THE TAXONOMY ADDED. The closing round of the lymphoma deep dive,
 * 3 November 2026.
 *
 * Why this file exists. The evidence facet (./lymphoma-evidence*.ts) was written on 1 October 2026 before the
 * taxonomy facet's entity records landed, so it attached the trials of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma and adult
 * T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma to the peripheral T-cell lymphoma hub and listed those diseases in PENDING_CANCERS.
 * When the entity pages arrived they had standard-of-care rows and no trials: on 3 November extranodal NK/T-cell
 * lymphoma, adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma and high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements held
 * no trial and no paper, and the two anaplastic large cell lymphomas held one trial each and no paper.
 *
 * What is here. (1) Nine trial records and ten paper records for the studies those pages' own treatment rows
 * rest on or name, and that the corpus did not hold. (2) Supplements that attach the entity pages to trials and
 * papers the corpus already held under the hubs (ECHELON-2, ALCANZA, MAVORIC, Study 201, the ISCL/EORTC staging
 * paper and five registry records). SMILE, JCOG9801 and the Hinuma paper are owned by the evidence facet and
 * were re-pointed in place.
 *
 * How the facts were obtained. Every paper was resolved by PubMed id through NCBI E-utilities on 3 November 2026
 * (the Europe PMC search service returned 503 that day) and its DOI, journal, year and authors are the indexed
 * record's; every figure below is quoted from the indexed abstract. Every ClinicalTrials.gov field (identifier,
 * start date, phase, enrolment, lead sponsor, conditions) was read from the v2 API the same day. Before anything
 * was written, the full corpus was searched by DOI, PubMed id and registry id for each study, and none was held.
 *
 * What is not here. Valemetostat has no drug record, so it is named in words and not linked.
 * JCOG0211 has no ClinicalTrials.gov record under that name or by its regimen, so it is a paper and not a trial.
 * There has never been a randomised trial confined to high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2
 * rearrangements, which the entity page already says; the one prospective study added is single-arm.
