Its own overview lists among its objectives policy advice, regulating and enhancing access to cancer care, research, resource mobilisation, and establishing and maintaining a cancer registry. Its offices are at No. 9 Henry Adefope Crescent, Utako, Abuja; the coordinates on this record are the Utako district point, not the building.\n\nNICRAT wrote the National Strategic Cancer Control Plan 2023 to 2027 and runs the National Cancer Registry of Nigeria. Under the 2024 National Cancer Registry Regulations cancer became a notifiable disease, with NICRAT to enforce them. NICRAT also implements the National Cancer Health Fund, which the 2025 imPACT Review describes as supporting chemotherapy and radiotherapy for breast, cervical and prostate cancer in six public comprehensive cancer centres, and works with the Nigeria Cancer Access Partnership, a pooled-purchase programme for cancer medicines whose network NICRAT reported growing from 18 to 24 centres in June 2026.\n\nIts activity report for January to August 2026 records more than 4,000 people screened, eight preventive oncology clinics opened, more than 100 cancer registrars trained, eight registries accredited to the IARC standard, a three-year technical support agreement with the African Cancer Registry Network, a Childhood Cancer Fund live at three centres (Federal Medical Centre Abeokuta, Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital Sokoto and Jos University Teaching Hospital), a memorandum signed for 35 additional linear accelerators, and Nigeria's first consolidated Cancer Burden Report (2024). In August 2026 the President approved a purpose-built NICRAT headquarters.",

    summary: "Nigeria's first cancer registry was set up in 1960 in the Pathology Department of University College Hospital, Ibadan, and its data appeared in the first three volumes of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. The Nigerian National System of Cancer Registries was conceived in 2009 by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Society of Oncology and Cancer Research of Nigeria and the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria to coordinate and strengthen registries and establish new ones; its 2015 report lists population-based registries in Abuja (founded 2009), Calabar (2004) and Ibadan (1960).\n\nThe 2024 National Cancer Registry Regulations made cancer a notifiable disease and established the National Cancer Registry of Nigeria, which the 2025 imPACT Review describes as comprising 26 population-based and hospital-based registries; five population-based registries (Abuja, Calabar, Ekiti, Enugu and Ibadan) contribute data to Nigeria's GLOBOCAN estimates and none has contributed to Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. The review notes that most registries have no dedicated budget and that the last national census was in 2006, which limits incidence rates. NICRAT's 2023 to 2027 plan gave a different count, 34 registries with 13 population-based and 24 hospital-based. NICRAT now runs the registry from Abuja; the coordinates on this record are an approximate Wuse district point.\n\nThe latest published population-based figures found for this record are for 2009 to 2014 (Ibadan and Abuja 2009 to 2010, Calabar 2009 to 2013, Abuja and Enugu 2012 to 2014).
