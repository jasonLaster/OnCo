  lede:
    "Spain has no single national cancer registry: its cancer counts are projections from regional registries, and they put 2026 at 301,884 new cancers. Its public health service, run by the regions, charges nothing for medicines given or dispensed in hospital, makes and funds two CAR-T cell therapies of its own, and authorised more clinical trials in 2025 than any other EU country by its regulator's count.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2022 estimate for Spain is 278,729 new cancers and 115,590 deaths for 2022. IARC labels that all-cancers figure ICD-10 C00-97, and it includes the 14,201 non-melanoma skin cancers IARC estimates separately, which REDECAN leaves out (without them GLOBOCAN's figure is about 264,500): REDECAN's 301,884 is a projection for 2026 that excludes non-melanoma skin cancer and, for the bladder only, also counts in situ and uncertain-behaviour tumours; that is one reason REDECAN's bladder figure (23,929) is above GLOBOCAN's (21,418). The two also differ in year, method (both are modelled estimates, from different projections) and standard population: REDECAN quotes world, 1976 European and 2013 European standardised rates, and its world-standard rate for 2026, 276.6 per 100,000, is close to GLOBOCAN's 274.6. INE's count of deaths from all tumours in 2022 was 114,828.",

            "REDECAN, the Red Española de Registros de Cáncer, was created in November 2010 to bring together Spain's population-based cancer registries and the Spanish childhood tumour registry. Its 2026 incidence estimates use the twelve consolidated registries that cover all ages: Asturias, Gran Canaria and Tenerife, Castellón, the province of Salamanca, Euskadi, Girona, Granada, La Rioja, the island of Mallorca, Murcia, Navarra and Tarragona, combined with INE mortality for every province up to 2023, and give a 95% interval for every figure: 293,067 to 311,416 for the 2026 total. The report includes all invasive cancers except non-melanoma skin cancer, and for bladder also in situ and uncertain-behaviour tumours. It warns that the 2020 estimates were very probably overestimates because the COVID-19 pandemic cut diagnoses, that how the pandemic affected 2021 to 2025 is still not clear, and that its 2026 figures should be read as the incidence there would be if nothing disturbed the health system's ability to diagnose. The survival report's twelve registries cover 25% of the Spanish population.",

The report itself notes that oral cavity, pharynx and lung cancer incidence is rising in women and falling in men, and that female breast cancer incidence has risen while its mortality has fallen. A 2026 REDECAN study of 153,599 cancers in adults aged 20 to 49 from fifteen registries, 1993 to 2018, found falls in larynx, lung, bladder and liver cancer in both sexes (annual percent changes of -3.1% to -8.7%), rises in kidney, thyroid and Hodgkin lymphoma in men and pancreas and lymphomas in women, and significant rises in stomach, colon, rectum, breast and cervical cancers in adults under 40.",

Age-standardised five-year net survival for those diagnosed in 2013 to 2017 was 57.4% (95% CI 57.1 to 57.8) in men and 65.2% (64.9 to 65.6) in women, and 60.9% for both sexes. In men it ranged from 9.6% for mesothelioma to 94.4% for testicular cancer, and in women from 10.7% for mesothelioma to 93.9% for thyroid cancer. Against 2008 to 2012 it rose significantly in fourteen tumour types, by 1.9 percentage points overall: by more than 5 points for acute myeloid leukaemia (22.6% to 28.9%), multiple myeloma (49.6% to 55.5%) and colon cancer (63.4% to 68.5%), and by 3 to 5 points for oral cavity and pharynx, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung (13.7% to 18.1%), rectum and stomach. The authors attribute the gains to diagnostic and treatment advances, as in the haematological cancers, and to earlier diagnosis, as in colorectal cancer with the spread of screening.

Real Decreto 415/2026 of 27 May, published in the BOE on 29 May 2026 and in force from 18 June 2026, creates a Sistema para la evaluación de las tecnologías sanitarias with two offices: the AEMPS for medicines and the RedETS network of health technology agencies for everything else. It aligns Spain with the EU regulation on joint clinical assessment, and adds what that regulation leaves to member states: categorisation of the relative effect, economic evaluation and positioning. Article 14 sets 70 days from the start date for the clinical report on a new medicine, and in any case no more than 15 days after the European Commission publishes its joint report where one exists, then 70 days for the non-clinical report, the two allowed to overlap; reassessments get 50 days, extendable by 25 if more evidence is requested. Article 15 states that the assessments are not binding.

The AEMPS can authorise it for one patient or through a temporary authorisation of use for a group. Off-label use is exceptional, limited to situations with no authorised alternative for that patient, and requires the treating doctor to justify it in the clinical record and obtain the patient's informed consent; the AEMPS may issue recommendations. Access to medicines authorised abroad but not in Spain is allowed when no medicine of the same composition is authorised in Spain and no authorised alternative suits the patient, and also for medicines authorised but not marketed in Spain.

The route is the hospital exemption in the EU advanced therapy regulation, which limits use to the member state where the product was developed and to a hospital under a doctor's responsibility. The evidence was the CART19-BE-01 trial at Hospital Clínic and Sant Joan de Déu, where 71.1% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had a measurable residual disease-negative complete response at day 100. The Ministerio de Sanidad lists ARI-0001 and the BCMA CAR-T ARI0002h as academic CAR-Ts funded by the national health service, beside six industrial ones.

        "Some official sources did not answer when this page was written: the Instituto de Salud Carlos III's website showed a maintenance page, INE's press release on deaths in 2024 returned a server error, and CIBERONC's directory of research groups loads only in a browser. The figures they hold are not on this page.",
      detail:
        "isciii.es returned a maintenance page, so the institute's budget, centres and funding calls are not described; its role is sourced from the CIBER consortium's page, a ClinicalTrials.gov collaborator listing and a paper's funding statement. INE's 2024 deaths press release returned HTTP 503, so the death figures were read from the same statistic through INE's public Tempus API (table 7947, final data for 2024). CIBERONC's group directory is filled by script and returned no groups to a plain request, so the number of CIBERONC groups is not stated. Europe PMC returned server errors and Crossref rate-limited requests, so DOIs for the new records were resolved through PubMed instead. REDECAN publishes no seat or address, so its record is placed at a country centroid. The role of the Organización Nacional de Trasplantes in cell therapy logistics was not researched for this page.",

  how:
    "Every card was written from Spanish official sources read in Spanish: REDECAN's 2026 incidence estimates and 2003-2017 survival report, INE's deaths by cause (table 7947, final 2024 data, read through INE's public API), the consolidated texts in the BOE of the Ley de garantías, Real Decreto 1015/2009 and Real Decreto 415/2026, the Ministerio de Sanidad's cancer strategy, advanced therapies pages and CIPM public reports, the 2025 country cancer profile it publishes, and the AEMPS's own announcements. Each figure was checked against the raw text of the PDF or page rather than a summary. The entity lists are drawn from OnCo records with Spanish institutions, companies or investigators; the new records added for this page (REDECAN, the AEMPS, the ISCIII, CIBERONC, GECP, PETHEMA, the two academic CAR-T trials, four papers and three people) carry their own sources.",
  verify:
    "Incidence figures are projections with confidence intervals, not counts; deaths are INE's final figures for 2024. Co-payment percentages and caps are those in force since 28 May 2026 and change by royal decree-law. The assessment timelines in Real Decreto 415/2026 apply only as each phase is brought in. Before relying on whether a particular medicine is paid for, check BIFIMED and ask the hospital pharmacy, because regional and hospital introduction follows the national decision.",
