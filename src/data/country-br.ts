/**
 * Brazil deep dive: the hand-written cards and tables for /countries/br/. Written on 3 November 2026 from Brazilian
 * primary sources read in Portuguese: INCA's Estimativa 2026 (triênio 2026 a 2028) and its statistics pages, the
 * Chamber of Deputies' consolidated text of Law 12.732/2012, the Senate's open-data record of Laws 14.758/2023 and
 * 14.454/2022, CONITEC's and ANS's own pages, ANVISA's service page, RDC 205/2017 and its 2026 news, the Ministry of
 * Health's announcements as republished by INCA, and the Hemocentro de Ribeirão Preto's pages on its CAR-T programme.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind:
 *  - incidence  INCA's Estimativa is a projection, not a count: new cases expected in each year of 2026 to 2028,
 *               modelled from the population-based registries (RCBP) and the mortality system (SIM). INCA says its
 *               editions must not be compared with each other as a time series.
 *  - deaths     per-site deaths in 2023 are quoted inside the Estimativa from INCA's mortality atlas; the latest
 *               national all-cancer total on INCA's statistics page is for 2021.
 *  - survival   Brazil publishes no national survival series; see the gaps.
 * The Planalto legislation site and INCA's document repository (ninho.inca.gov.br) refused automated requests, so the
 * laws were read from the Chamber of Deputies' and Senate's copies and the Estimativa from INCA's web edition.

    "Cancer in Brazil from Brazilian sources: INCA's 2026 to 2028 estimate of about 781,000 new cases a year, the free public health system and the private plans a quarter of the population holds, the laws that set 30 days to a diagnosis and 60 days to a first treatment, CONITEC's deadlines and the courts, ANVISA's timelines and backlog, screening, and a national CAR-T made in a public university.",
  lede:
    "Brazil writes cancer care into law: health is a constitutional right, the public system must start a first cancer treatment within 60 days of the pathology report, and a national cancer policy has existed by statute since 2023. Most Brazilians rely on that free public system; about one in four also holds a private health plan.",
  globocanNote:
    "Brazil's own figures come from INCA's Estimativa, which projects new cases for each year of 2026 to 2028 from the population-based registries and the mortality system, and which INCA says should not be compared edition with edition. GLOBOCAN 2024 is IARC's separate model for 2024 and runs higher than INCA for several sites: 90,307 breast cancers against INCA's 78,610 a year, and 43,788 lung cancers against 35,380. For deaths, GLOBOCAN's 36,933 lung cancer deaths compare with 31,237 registered in Brazil's mortality system in 2023. Both correct for under-registration and ill-defined causes of death in different ways, so use either set consistently rather than mixing them. GLOBOCAN's all-cancers line above (C00-97, 640,575 new cases in 2024) includes non-melanoma skin cancer, of which it counts 49,282, leaving 591,293 without it; INCA's 781,000 includes 263,280 such cancers and its 518,000 leaves them out. Because the two models differ most for this one cancer, compare totals without it.",

          detail:
            "INCA's first Estimativa appeared in 1995, and it describes its current method as analogous to the one IARC uses for GLOBOCAN; the main inputs are the population-based cancer registries (Registros de Câncer de Base Populacional, RCBP) and the national mortality information system (SIM). Where a state or capital has consolidated registry data, short-term prediction models are fitted; elsewhere INCA applies the registry's incidence-to-mortality ratio, or the median ratio of its region, to modelled 2026 mortality. The 2026 to 2028 edition, launched on World Cancer Day, 4 February 2026, applies corrections for under-registration of both deaths and cases, and INCA states that its editions should not be compared directly as a time series, because better data and revised methods move the numbers. Non-melanoma skin cancer is estimated at 263,280 new cases a year (136,180 in men, 127,100 in women) and is presented separately because of its high incidence and low lethality.",

Ten are bought centrally by the Ministry and distributed to the states; the rest are bought by the accredited cancer centres and reimbursed through the outpatient procedure authorisation (APAC) with a national price agreement. The same package funded robotic cancer surgery in the public network for the first time and widened access to breast reconstruction. The measures sit under the Pharmaceutical Assistance in Oncology component (AF-Onco). The AMAZONA III cohort showed the consequences of a two-track system for one cancer: women with breast cancer treated in the public system were diagnosed at stage III more than twice as often as privately insured women (33.5 against 14.7 per cent).",

      title: "Sources OnCo could not reach or verify",
      plain:
        "Some official sources refused automated requests or did not show their figures in a form OnCo could read, so a few numbers a reader might expect are missing. They are listed here rather than filled from memory.",
      detail:
        "The Planalto legislation site and INCA's document repository (ninho.inca.gov.br) refused connections, so laws were read from the Chamber of Deputies' and Senate's copies; the full text of Law 14.758/2023 and of its April 2026 amendment was not read, only the Senate's summary. The national all-cancer death total for 2023 was not found on an INCA page (2021 is given). CONITEC's cost-effectiveness reference value, reported in the press in 2022, could not be verified from an official document. The current number of UNACON and CACON accredited hospitals loads dynamically on INCA's page and was not captured. ANVISA's average approval times for new cancer medicines, the date ANVISA joined Project Orbis, and how the courts have interpreted Law 14.454/2022 were not verified. The share of Brazilian health spending paid out of pocket was not sourced. LACOG's own website did not respond.",

Every figure was checked against the raw text of its source. Papers were resolved through Crossref and PubMed and trials through the ClinicalTrials.gov API. The institutions, trials, papers and people listed are drawn from OnCo's graph.",
  verify:
    "Brazilian rules change by decree, resolution and provisional measure, and INCA's estimates are projections that INCA itself says should not be compared between editions. Check the current text of a law or resolution before relying on a deadline, and ask the hospital's social service or the state health department about the 60-day and 30-day rights in a specific case.",
