  description:
    "Cancer in Egypt from Egyptian sources: the national registry's figures from three governorates, which put liver, breast and bladder cancer first; a universal health insurance law that reaches six of 27 governorates and charges people with cancer nothing at the point of care; treatment at state expense for everyone else; one authority that buys medicines for every public hospital; the Egyptian Drug Authority and its reliance route; a clinical research law that limits foreign drugs to late-phase trials; and national programmes that tested over 60 million people for hepatitis C and offer breast checks to every adult woman.",
  lede:
    "Egypt's own national cancer figures come from registries in three governorates counted in 2008 to 2011, which put liver cancer first, then breast and bladder. Since then Egypt has tested more than 60 million people for hepatitis C, the main cause of its liver cancer, and treated more than 4.1 million, by WHO's count; a 2018 universal health insurance law that exempts people with cancer from fees has reached six of the 27 governorates; and a presidential programme offers a breast check to every woman from 18.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Egypt is 137,390 new cancers and 80,512 deaths in 2024, an age-standardised incidence of 137.6 per 100,000 (world standard) that includes 1,452 non-melanoma skin cancers. IARC codes the incidence as subnational rates applied to the 2024 population, and the deaths as derived from those incidence estimates through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios, not from counted deaths. Egypt's national registry programme measured 166.6 per 100,000 for 2008 to 2011, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, in three governorates covering 20.9% of the population, and its own projection at those rates was 168,723 new cancers in 2025, about 23% more than IARC's 2024 figure. The largest difference is liver cancer: the registry measured an age-standardised rate of 43.6 per 100,000 in 2008 to 2011, IARC estimates 24.0 for 2024 (23,287 cases). The registry's figures predate the national hepatitis C treatment campaign, hold 2008 to 2011 rates constant and leave out Greater Cairo; IARC's file does not say which registries it used. GLOBOCAN's breast cancer rate is computed for women only, so it cannot be compared directly with the registry's both-sexes rate below.",

            "In Egypt's national registry data, liver cancer was the commonest cancer, nearly one in four of all cancers, followed by breast cancer and bladder cancer; together they were about 46% of cancers. In men liver cancer was one in three cancers and bladder one in ten; in women breast cancer was one in three and liver cancer about one in seven.",
          detail:
            "The National Cancer Registry Program's report for 2008 to 2011 gives an age-standardised incidence (world standard) of 166.6 per 100,000 for both sexes, 175.9 in men and 157.0 in women, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer. Liver cancer was 23.81% of cancers with a rate of 43.6, breast 15.41% (24.3), bladder 6.94% (13.5), brain and nervous system 5.29% (8.5), non-Hodgkin lymphoma 4.64% (7.5) and lung 4.22% (7.5). In men, liver was 33.63% (61.8) and bladder 10.71% (21.1), then lung, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, brain and prostate (9.3); in women breast was 32.04% (48.8) and liver 13.54% (24.4), then brain, ovary, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and thyroid. Liver cancer was most common in Lower Egypt, where its rate was 56.8 per 100,000 and its share 29.6%, and least common in Upper Egypt (13.1 and 8.2%). Applying the same age-specific rates to Egypt's growing and ageing population gives 114,985 new cancers in 2013, 144,255 in 2020, 168,723 in 2025 and 331,169 in 2050, which the authors attribute increasingly to ageing.",

            "Egypt does not count every cancer in the country. Its national registry programme, set up in 2008, built a network of population registries; its national report used three of them, in governorates chosen to represent the north, middle and south, and estimated the national figures from them. The only national report OnCo could find covers 2008 to 2011.",
          detail:
            "The National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt, established in 2008, stratified the country into Lower, Middle and Upper Egypt and set up a population-based registry in one governorate of each: Damietta in the Nile delta (registration years 2009 to 2011), Minya in Middle Egypt (2009) and Aswan in Upper Egypt (2008), each located in the Ministry of Health cancer centre of the governorate. Together they covered 20.9% of the population; Greater Cairo and Alexandria were not included, which the authors put down to the difficulty of collecting data on a population that moves in and out daily. The paper's map shows five peripheral registries in the national network; the report used these three. Doctors abstracted records from the cancer centres and from national tertiary centres such as the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University, the paediatric oncology hospital in Cairo and the South Egypt Cancer Institute in Assiut, and from the Health Insurance Organization, the government-subsidised treatment programme and death records; the national identity number was used to remove duplicates, and death-certificate-only cases were almost 8%. Before the programme, the authors write, the only published incidence rates came from a single delta governorate, Gharbiah, whose last internal report was for 2002. They caution that their rates rest on a short initial phase of registration and a model that applies regional rates to the whole country.",

That is why Egypt's breast programme starts at 18 with a questionnaire and a hand examination rather than with mammograms for older women.",
          detail:
            "The 2026 economic evaluation of the Presidential Initiative for Women's Health, written by Ministry of Health and Population staff with Egyptian oncologists, states in its background that Egyptian patients have a mean age at diagnosis of approximately 50.4 years against a median of 63 in the US SEER database, and that 20% of Egyptian patients were younger than 40 against 5% in SEER, citing earlier Egyptian studies. It notes that most Egyptian patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease, with an average delay of about seven months between symptoms and treatment, 61% of it attributed to patient-related factors. The programme's own data, set out under screening below, show the stage at which cancers were found after five years of the initiative. These background figures are cited from other studies in the paper and were not re-derived by OnCo.",

WHO announced on 20 December 2024 that Egypt had reached maturity level 3 for medicines regulation after a benchmarking finalised in November 2024, building on maturity level 3 for vaccines in March 2022, and describes Egypt as the first country in Africa to reach that level for both. WHO's scale runs to level 4, and it notes that authorities at level 3 or 4 may qualify as WHO-listed authorities after further assessment. The authority's registration guideline sets pricing within the registration process: for biological products, pricing of fast-track and reliance products is to be determined within 30 working days of a complete pricing file, and 60 for normal-track products.",

Under the new programme the number of hepatitis C-related liver cancer cases was projected to peak earlier and lower, at about 29,000 in 2025, with incidence peaking at about 14 per 100,000 in 2022, and about 956,000 cases were averted between 2015 and 2050.

    "Every card was written from Egyptian official sources or peer-reviewed papers, read raw rather than through a summary: the Universal Health Insurance Authority's Arabic posts, with the Andersen Egypt translation of Law 2 of 2018 for its articles and tables; the Egyptian Drug Authority's copies of Law 151 of 2019 and Law 214 of 2020 and its 2026 guidelines; the National Cancer Institute's Arabic home page; WHO's announcements; the 57357 hospital's pages through the Internet Archive; and the national registry's 2014 report, the 2018 hepatitis C model and the 2026 breast programme evaluation, each resolved through Europe PMC and Crossref. The ministry's figures on treatment at state expense were read as reported by Al Mal News. The new records for this page are the registry programme, the drug authority, the procurement authority, the universal insurer and the three papers.",

    "Registry figures are for 2008 to 2011 and the projections hold those rates fixed. Insurance coverage changes as each governorate joins the universal system, so check with the Universal Health Insurance Authority (its line is 15344) whether it applies where a patient lives. The drug authority's timelines are targets in its guidelines, not measured times. Before relying on whether a medicine is covered, ask the treating hospital which route, insurance or state expense, will pay for it.",
