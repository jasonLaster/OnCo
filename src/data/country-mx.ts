    "Cancer in Mexico from Mexican sources: INEGI's 95,108 deaths from malignant tumours in 2024, a national cancer registry created in law in 2017 that has not yet published a national count, free care for people without social security through IMSS-Bienestar and a fund for high-cost treatment, the national formulary and its economic evaluation, COFEPRIS's 2025 reliance route with a 45-working-day limit, breast and cervical screening and what share of women they reach, and the cancer trials with sites in Mexico.",
  lede:
    "Mexico counts its cancer deaths precisely, 95,108 from malignant tumours in 2024, but has no national count of new cancers: the registry the law created in 2017 has published no national figure, so incidence comes from IARC's model. Care is split between social security institutes for people in formal work and free public care for everyone else, and since 2025 the medicines regulator can approve a medicine by relying on a full approval by a reference regulator abroad.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Mexico is 201,137 new cancers and 96,264 deaths in 2024, including 6,476 non-melanoma skin cancers (194,661 without them). Mexico has no national incidence registry, so IARC's incidence figure is modelled: its method code for Mexico is national mortality estimates applied to mortality-to-incidence ratios taken from registries in neighbouring countries, which is also how the authors of the Mexican registry network describe it. The deaths figure is close to Mexico's own count: INEGI registered 95,108 deaths from malignant tumours in 2024 (codes 08 to 15 of the Mexican list of diseases), 11.6% of all 819,672 deaths registered that year. The only population-based counts of new cancers Mexico has published come from a network of nine city registries that ran from 2017 to 2020 and covered about 11% of the population; its 13,517 cases are not a national incidence and cannot be compared with GLOBOCAN's total, though breast cancer was the commonest in both.",

Leukaemia had the highest cancer death rate under 20 (1.9 per 100,000 girls, 2.4 per 100,000 boys); at 20 to 29 it was leukaemia in women (2.1) and testicular cancer in men (3.4).

A 2021 amendment added a section for children under the childhood cancer law. The Instituto Nacional de Cancerología coordinated the network: registries in Acapulco, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Guadalajara, Hermosillo, León, Monterrey, Tijuana and Toluca recorded 13,517 new cancers from 2017 to 2020, from 481 public and private sources but without IMSS institutions, which cover around 55% of the population, before budget restrictions suspended it in 2020; its authors call the results partial. A registry in Mérida, run at an IMSS institution since 2016, covers 908,536 people. On 22 September 2025 the Secretario de Salud presented the registry's paediatric module; the estimate of new children's cancers quoted in the press report was 3,000 to 5,000 a year.",

High cost means treatments and medicines defined by the Consejo de Salubridad General with explicit clinical and epidemiological criteria, selected for safety, efficacy, cost, effectiveness, professional ethics and social acceptability, because of their complexity or specialisation and how often they occur.

            "The Acuerdo published in the Diario Oficial on 18 July 2025 issued general guidelines for an abbreviated regulatory route, in force 30 working days after publication, that recognise as equivalent the requirements, tests and evaluation procedures of reference regulatory authorities and the WHO prequalification programme, and adopt the WHO's good reliance practices. Article 23 names the reference authorities for medicines: founding or standing regulatory members of the ICH, and WHO-Listed Authorities with the marketing authorisation function; for generics, WHO prequalification also counts. The route covers new molecules, generics, innovator biotechnology products, biosimilars, biologicals and vaccines. The product must be identical to the one the reference authority approved, the foreign approval must be no more than 5 years old, and article 20 excludes approvals other than an ordinary one: approvals that themselves relied on another regulator, recognition, accelerated approval, conditional approval, emergency authorisation and court-ordered approval. For innovator biologicals and vaccines the new-molecules committee gives its opinion within fifteen working days. COFEPRIS checks only that the file is complete, and article 37 gives it a maximum of 45 working days to resolve a medicine application. The guidelines replaced the separate equivalence agreements published from 5 October 2012 to 11 June 2025.",

The then commissioner, Armida Zúñiga Estrada, said implementation of international standards had gone from 10% to 90% in a single semester, which would let COFEPRIS submit its letter of intent to be recognised as a WHO-Listed Authority. The release does not separate cancer medicines from the 312 registrations or the trials from other areas, and gives no median time to approval. The press reported in January 2026 that Víctor Hugo Borja Aburto took over as commissioner.",

The 2007 modification of NOM-014-SSA2-1994 tells first-contact health staff to offer cervical screening to every woman aged 25 to 64, with cytology as the method, visual inspection with acetic acid only where cytology is not available, molecular HPV tests as a complement, and a three-yearly interval after two consecutive negative yearly smears. The Auditoría Superior de la Federación's audit of the 2022 accounts describes the practice in the sector's institutions: cytology every three years for women aged 25 to 34, and a high-risk HPV test every five years for women aged 35 to 64.",

Of the 2022 mammograms, 0.8% (4,180) were positive. From 2018 to 2022 the services performed 2,232,049 HPV tests on women aged 35 to 64, 20.2% of the eligible women, down from 59.5% in 2018, and no state met its target; the centre cited insufficient supplies, a change of test supplier, late hiring of laboratory staff and unsuitable sampling spaces. The audit also quotes the 2021 to 2024 cancer action programme: in 2018 mammography coverage in Mexico was 24.4%, clinical breast examination 26.7% and cervical screening by cytology and HPV test 46.4%, against the 70% coverage the programme says the WHO recommends for mammography screening to reduce mortality by 20% to 30% in women aged 50 and over, and the 70% it proposes for cervical screening.",

This matters for cancer in particular, because some cancer medicines and indications first reach the market in the United States through accelerated approval and in the European Union through conditional marketing authorisation, on response rates before survival results are available. Under the Mexican rules those indications cannot use the 45-working-day route until the reference regulator has converted them to an ordinary approval. Article 29 adds that the foreign approval must have been granted within the last five years, and article 30 requires the applicant to declare that the medicine carries no special warnings from other regulators and has not been withdrawn anywhere for safety or efficacy reasons.",
