    "Cancer in Romania from Romanian sources: 46,004 cancer deaths registered in 2023 but no national count of new cancers yet, a national registry founded by government decision in 2023, a cancer plan written into Law 293/2022, cancer medicines free through the National Oncology Programme, a points scale that decides reimbursement, an average 762 days from EU authorisation to reimbursement for cancer medicines in the W.A.I.T. 2024 survey, and cervical cancer screening being rebuilt around the HPV test.",
  lede:
    "Romania counts its cancer deaths, 46,004 in 2023, but not yet its new cancers: a national registry was founded by government decision in 2023 and the OECD's 2025 profile says it was not yet working. Cancer care and cancer medicines are free once cancer is confirmed, whether or not the patient is insured, but new cancer medicines reach Romanian patients later than the EU average, and cervical cancer is almost three times as common as the EU average.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Romania is 98,829 new cancers and 53,326 deaths in 2024, labelled ICD-10 C00-97 and including 3,453 non-melanoma skin cancers (95,376 without them). Romania has no national cancer registry yet, so there is no national count of new cancers to compare: the OECD and European Commission's 2025 profile uses the European Cancer Information System's estimate of about 100,471 new cancers expected in 2022, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, also a model built on earlier trends. Deaths are counted: the National Institute of Statistics' figures, as published by Eurostat, record 46,004 deaths from malignant cancers (C00-C97) registered in Romania in 2023. GLOBOCAN's modelled 53,326 for 2024 is about 16% higher, and the gap is largest for lung cancer (10,486 against 8,878). Neither source explains the difference, so it is stated here rather than explained. The OECD profile quotes 45,866 cancer deaths in 2022 from the same statistics institute, close to Eurostat's 45,853 for all neoplasms that year.",

Lung cancer caused 8,878 of the 2023 deaths, colon, rectum and anus 6,211, breast 3,285 and pancreas 2,706. The OECD and European Commission's 2025 profile puts Romania's age-standardised cancer mortality in 2021 at 243 per 100,000, 3% above the EU average, with men 10% above and women 4% below. Between 2011 and 2021 cancer mortality fell by 8% among Romanian men, against 16% across the EU, and by 7% among women, against 9%. The profile records that mortality from breast, colorectal, prostate, kidney and melanoma cancers rose in Romania over that decade while it fell across the EU, and it links the growing colorectal gap to the absence of screening outside pilot projects.",

Providers that diagnose or treat cancer must report every reportable tumour, coded with ICD-O-3, within 30 days of diagnosis, of a revised diagnosis, of the end of initial treatment or of death; reportable tumours are all in situ and invasive cancers except basal cell skin carcinoma, all brain and spinal tumours, and borderline tumours. Fines of 500 to 5,000 lei for repeated failure to report, after a first warning, take effect only 30 days after the registry's software is running, and the software is paid for from Romania's recovery and resilience plan. The decision repealed the 2007 order that had set up regional registries. The government's explanatory note of July 2023 stated that Romania had no national register from which annual incidence could be calculated, so that health policy rested on fragmented data, mostly estimates. The OECD and European Commission's 2025 profile says the registry was expected to be fully working by the end of 2025 and linked to the screening registries and the childhood cancer registry; no published output from it was found for this page.",

In the text consolidated to July 2020 and published by the agency, a new medicine or new indication earns up to 15 points for France's HAS rating of its therapeutic benefit, up to 15 for a positive NICE or SMC opinion in the United Kingdom and up to 15 for added benefit found by Germany's IQWiG or G-BA; 25 points if it is reimbursed in at least 14 EU member states and the United Kingdom, 20 for 8 to 13 and 10 for 3 to 7; and up to 30 for cost against a comparator, with none if it costs more than 3% more per patient. A Romanian clinical trial of the medicine in that indication, an EUnetHTA assessment or a notified real-world data study earns 45 points instead of the three foreign assessments.

Among the causes it names are companies waiting for other countries to decide before applying, bureaucracy, an assessment system it calls restrictive towards innovation, budget limits and an understaffed assessment team. The plan's measures include strengthening the agency's assessment department and making updates of the reimbursed list and treatment protocols predictable. The OECD's 2025 profile adds that national rules on the assessment process have been simplified in recent years to shorten the time between authorisation and availability.",

The European Cancer Inequalities Registry's site rejected scripts, so the OECD profile was read from an Internet Archive copy. Ministry of Health order 3735/2024 on cervical screening and the 2024 breast and colorectal methodologies were known only through the sources that cite them.",

        "Order 861/2014, in the text consolidated to July 2020 that the medicines agency publishes, lists the points for each criterion but the thresholds between unconditional inclusion, conditional inclusion and non-inclusion were not in that text, and later amendments were not read. The only measured delays found are the industry's W.A.I.T. figures, 883 days in the 2020 survey as quoted by the national cancer plan and 762 days for cancer medicines in the 2024 survey; no official Romanian figure was found, and the 2025 W.A.I.T. survey was not read. No national coverage figure for the HPV-based cervical programme or the 2024 breast and colorectal programmes was found; the newest coverage figures are 2019 survey data. Whether the 20% funding floor in article 5 of Law 293/2022 has been met in any year was not established.",

    "Every card was written from sources read raw: in Romanian, Law 293/2022 and the national cancer plan in its annex, Government Decision 663/2023 on the National Cancer Registry and the Ministry of Health's explanatory note for it, Ministry of Health order 861/2014 on health technology assessment, the National Health Insurance House's National Oncology Programme and cost-volume pages, a press release of the National Institute of Public Health, and the cancer institutes' history pages; in English, the OECD and European Commission's Country Cancer Profile Romania 2025, Eurostat's causes-of-death table for Romania and the EFPIA W.A.I.T. 2024 survey. Several Romanian official sites refused scripts, and those pages were read through the Internet Archive or from copies on other official sites, as each link says. Trial counts come from OnCo's own ClinicalTrials.gov records. The new records added for this page are the two cancer institutes in Bucharest and Cluj-Napoca, the National Cancer Registry, the National Institute of Public Health, the Health Insurance House and the medicines agency.",
  verify:
    "Romania has no national count of new cancers yet, so every incidence figure here is an estimate. The reimbursed list, treatment protocols and cost-volume contracts change during the year: before relying on whether a medicine is paid for, ask the treating oncologist and check the current Government decision and protocol. The screening programmes are moving from pilots to national programmes, so what is offered locally may differ from what is described here.",
