    journal: "The Lancet Regional Health - Southeast Asia", year: 2025, doi: "10.1016/j.lansea.2025.100615", pmid: "40584692", authors: "Virani SS, Ahmed KS, Springer M, et al.", paperType: "review",
    tldr: "A review of every cancer registry it could find in Pakistan: seventeen, covering only 19 of the country's 129 cities, with no unified national registry.",
    summary: "Following Joanna Briggs Institute and PRISMA-ScR guidance, the authors searched databases and grey literature, screened 3,714 abstracts and included 102 studies, 92 reporting registry data and 10 describing registry characteristics.",
    findings: [
      "Seventeen cancer registries were identified, with varying scope and geographical coverage.",
      "Only 19 of Pakistan's 129 cities contribute data to at least one registry.",
      "Data collection ranged from paper forms to advanced software; the Karachi Cancer Registry had the highest research output.",
      "Funding sources were limited and several registries faced operational challenges.",
    ],
    whatItMeans: "Explains why Pakistan's cancer numbers are estimates: the registries that exist cover a minority of the country and do not share one method. The authors call for a national registry system, which the 2025 amendment to the National Institute of Health law now requires.",
    caveats: ["Counts registries that have published; registries with no publications may be missed."],
