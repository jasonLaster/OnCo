    summary: "Government Decision 663/2023, in force from 4 August 2023, founds the Registrul Național de Cancer as the information system for the named registration of new cancer cases on a population basis, to monitor cancer incidence nationally, evaluate the impact of the disease and support public health policy. It is owned and run by the National Institute of Public Health through its national centres for non-communicable disease surveillance and for public health statistics. Every public and private provider that diagnoses or treats cancer must report each new primary tumour, coded in ICD-O-3, within 30 days of diagnosis, of any change of diagnosis or of the end of initial treatment; county public health directorates report deaths. Reportable tumours are all in situ and invasive cancers except basal cell skin carcinomas, all brain and spinal tumours whatever their behaviour, and borderline tumours. Fines of 500 to 5,000 lei for providers who do not report apply only 30 days after the registry's software is running, which is paid for from Romania's recovery and resilience plan. The decision repealed the 2007 order that had set up regional cancer registries.\n\nBefore the decision, the annex to Law 293/2022 recorded only two working regional registries, in Cluj and Timiș. The OECD and European Commission's Country Cancer Profile of 2025 says Romania does not have a national cancer registry, that only two of eight regional registries collect data routinely, and that the national registry was expected to be fully working by the end of 2025, connected to the screening registries and the national childhood cancer registry.",
