Its latest bulletin counts 124,801 new cancers and 44,545 cancer deaths registered in 2024, and says deaths are badly undercounted because regional registries have lost access to death records.",
    summary: "The registry traces its legal start to the Ministry of Health's order No. 10 of 30 December 1996 on creating a national cancer registry, built on a state system of compulsory cancer registration that its own history dates to 1953. A population-based registry runs in every region, inside the regional cancer centres, and a hospital registry system is used in 26 of the largest cancer clinics, which send electronic discharge summaries to the population registry. Its central unit sits in the National Cancer Institute in Kyiv. The registry says it covers the whole population, that its data appear in volumes X to XII of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, and that it has been a member of the European Network of Cancer Registries since the end of the 1990s.\n\nBulletin No. 27, \"Cancer in Ukraine, 2024-2025\", published in Kyiv in 2026, counts 124,801 new cancers in 2024 (60,397 in men and 64,404 in women) and 44,545 cancer deaths, excluding Crimea and Sevastopol. It gives only counts and proportions: with no population figures from the State Statistics Service for 2024 and 2025, it says, rates per 100,000 cannot be calculated. It reports a growing undercount of deaths since 2015, worse since 2019, because regional registries lost access to death records, and an undercount of cases in Donetsk and Luhansk since 2014 and in Zaporizhzhia and Kherson since 2022 because of occupation and displacement. It concludes that, in present conditions, it can keep only the count of new cancers at a reliable level, close to 95%, and not earlier than a year after the year ends.",

Chemotherapy for cancer is a package paid as a global rate, built from an annual capitation of 36,807 hryvnias per patient with age weights: 3.555 for children, 0.97 for adults treated in hospital and 0.7 for adults treated only as outpatients. Radiotherapy is paid per course at 51,368 hryvnias, weighted 1.5 for a linear accelerator, gamma knife or brachytherapy and 0.753 for older cobalt or X-ray units. Blood cancers have their own package at 74,429 hryvnias per patient per year, and PET-CT is paid at 19,185 hryvnias a scan, with 4,000 scans planned for 2026.\n\nThe same resolution lists the medicines the service reimburses through pharmacies. For cancer the 2026 list holds three: exemestane, letrozole and tamoxifen, for breast cancer patients prescribed hormone therapy. The resolution also has the service assess primary care providers once a year, by 30 November, on how much of their population is covered by screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Providers in areas with active fighting or under occupation are handled under separate rules.",

It publishes each application and conclusion. For trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, applied for on 1 August 2025, the conclusion of 27 February 2026 found the cost per quality-adjusted life year above five times GDP per head (659,720 hryvnias, on 2021 figures) and so not cost-effective on Ukraine's recommended scale, and still recommended it for central purchase, including through a managed entry agreement.",
