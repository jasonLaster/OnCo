Its own history says it began operating on 2 September 2013 and was handed over to the ministry on 18 September 2013; the ground-breaking was on 9 January 2007. Its main services are radiotherapy and oncology, nuclear medicine, surgical oncology and palliative care. The National Strategic Plan for Cancer Control Programme 2021-2025 lists it among the six Ministry of Health oncology centres that give both systemic treatment and radiotherapy, records PSMA-directed radioligand therapy for prostate cancer at the institute in 2020, and notes that its radiology department kept low-dose CT lung screening as a routine service after a national study was stopped.\n\nIts National Cancer Registry Department runs the Malaysia National Cancer Registry, a nationwide population-based registry since 2007 covering 13 states and 3 federal territories. The third five-year report, Malaysia National Cancer Registry Report 2017-2021 (December 2025), counts 168,823 new cancers in Malaysian citizens and residents diagnosed in 2017 to 2021, at age-standardised rates of 107.3 per 100,000 in men and 120.8 in women. Cases reach the registry through the M2b online notification module of the Malaysian Health Data Warehouse (since 2018), a Director General of Health circular of April 2020 that made notification mandatory in government facilities, pathology and discharge records, and death records. The registry also published the Malaysian Study on Cancer Survival (MySCan) in 2018, for cancers diagnosed in 2007 to 2011.\n\nThe coordinates are a Putrajaya centroid, not the street address.",

In a 2016 parliamentary answer the minister gave chemotherapy charges of RM200, RM100 and RM50 per treatment in first, second and third class, and a 50% reduction in third class with no RM5 specialist registration charge for citizens aged 60 and over.\n\nIts Pharmaceutical Services Programme keeps the Ministry of Health Medicines Formulary (Formulari Ubat KKM), which listed 1,650 preparations of 864 chemical entities in January 2025.
