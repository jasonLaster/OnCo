    "Cancer in Colombia from Colombian sources: the national cancer institute's estimate of 101,483 new cancers a year in 2017 to 2021, the insurers' audited cancer cohort of 759,390 people in 2025, the contributory and subsidised regimes and the MIPRES route for medicines outside the benefit plan, the tutela that patients use to claim care, INVIMA's 180 and 30 working-day evaluation rules, value assessment and price ceilings for new medicines, screening rules, the imatinib public interest declaration and the childhood cancer laws.",
  lede:
    "Colombia counts cancer in two ways: its national cancer institute estimates about 101,500 new cancers a year from four city registries and death records, and every health insurer must report each patient it covers to an audited fund, the Cuenta de Alto Costo. Almost everyone is insured through the contributory or the subsidised regime; medicines outside the benefit plan are prescribed through a national system called MIPRES, and patients who are refused care can go to a judge through the tutela.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Colombia is 123,053 new cancers and 55,981 deaths in 2024, including 3,281 non-melanoma skin cancers (119,772 without them), with an age-standardised incidence of 180.75 per 100,000. GLOBOCAN builds Colombia's incidence from subnational registry rates applied to the 2024 population (method 2b) and its deaths from trends in national death rates projected to 2024 (method 1). The national cancer institute's own estimate is lower and older: a mean of 101,483 new cancers a year in 2017 to 2021 (47,393 in men and 54,090 in women), all cancers except skin, with age-standardised rates of 176.6 per 100,000 in men and 177.4 in women. The institute derives its figure from the incidence-to-mortality ratios of four registries (Cali, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Pasto, 2013 to 2017) applied to each department's recorded deaths, so the years, the population and the method all differ. Deaths differ too: the institute counted 44,355 recorded cancer deaths a year in 2017 to 2021, and the Ministry's cancer plan gives 49,795 for 2024 from DANE's vital statistics, against GLOBOCAN's projected 55,981; neither source explains that gap. Both put breast cancer first and prostate second; GLOBOCAN then has colorectum, stomach and thyroid, the same next three as the institute.",

            "The Instituto Nacional de Cancerología's estimates, published online on 27 December 2024 by Constanza Pardo-Ramos of its epidemiological surveillance group and Ricardo Cendales-Duarte, give mean annual figures for 2017 to 2021: 12,236 breast cancers in women (age-standardised rate 40.2 per 100,000), 12,090 prostate cancers (43.6), 4,694 stomach cancers in men (17.3) and 2,985 in women (9.4), 3,991 bowel cancers in men (14.7) and 4,688 in women (14.6; the text gives 4,668), 6,138 thyroid cancers in women (21.0) and 1,194 in men, and 4,331 cervical cancers (14.8). Recorded deaths averaged 44,355 a year, 21,683 in men and 22,672 in women, with the highest death rates for prostate cancer in men (11.8 per 100,000, the same as stomach cancer in the paper's table) and breast cancer in women (11.4). The highest all-cancer incidence rates were in La Guajira and Risaralda for both sexes, followed by Norte de Santander in men and Huila in women. The Ministry's 2026 cancer plan, quoting the institute's Infocáncer system and DANE's vital statistics, gives an age-standardised cancer death rate falling from 76.6 per 100,000 in 1997 (23,326 deaths) to 66.9 in 2024 (49,795 deaths), with rising death rates from bowel cancer and falling ones for breast, prostate, stomach and cervical cancer.",

The two give different numbers because they count different things.",
          detail:
            "The institute's paper states that Colombia has seven population-based registries, all covering cities, and that its estimates use the four whose data met the quality standard for Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volume XII: Cali, Bucaramanga, Manizales and Pasto. A model fitted to their 2013 to 2017 incidence and deaths is applied to each department's recorded deaths for 2017 to 2021, and the national figure is the sum of the departments; the paper puts the quality of mortality data at 96%. The Cali registry has run since 1962. Separately, under Resolución 0247 de 2014 every insurer, special and exception regime and departmental health authority must report to the Cuenta de Alto Costo every person with cancer it attended. Its 2025 report, covering 2 January 2024 to 1 January 2025, audited 806,503 records against clinical notes and counted 69,571 newly reported cases and 759,390 prevalent cases of all ages; it also found 18,925 people reported for the first time who had been diagnosed earlier and had no care recorded in the period, down from 22,186 a year before. The Ministry's 2026 plan sets out to make the population registries the official standard for incidence and survival where they operate.",

Decreto 433 de 2018 applies this to new medicines: INVIMA sends the applicant's dossier to the IETS within five days, the IETS consults publicly on the question and on its result, and classifies the medicine as significantly more effective (category 1), more effective (2), favourable (3), similar (4) or unfavourable (5) against the comparator, or unclassifiable (6), with the level of uncertainty; it may add cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses, and for orphan diseases does only the classification and budget impact.

The Instituto Nacional de Cancerología's epidemiological surveillance group produced the national estimates for 2017 to 2021, and Ley 2291 de 2023 made the institute the technical and scientific authority for cancer control and a reference centre for cancer care and research, according to the Ministry's 2026 cancer plan. The Cuenta de Alto Costo publishes yearly reports and survival analyses with clinical reviewers from the Asociación Colombiana de Hematología y Oncología. The Cali registry's 2018 methods paper reports 88.5% morphological verification and participation in the CONCORD and SURVCAN-3 survival studies.",

    "Every card was written from Colombian sources read in Spanish from their raw text: the Instituto Nacional de Cancerología's 2017 to 2021 estimates (its paper in the Revista Colombiana de Cancerología), the Cuenta de Alto Costo's 2025 adult report, 2024 paediatric report and 2014 to 2022 survival report, the laws as published by the Secretaría del Senado, the Ministry of Health's resolutions on the benefit plan, MIPRES, screening, the cancer plan and imatinib, INVIMA's legal compilation for the registration decrees, the price commission's circulars and the Defensoría del Pueblo's summary of health tutelas. Resolución 3280 de 2018 is a scanned document and was read by OCR, with the page image checked where an age mattered. The Cali registry paper was resolved through Europe PMC and its abstract read. The trial count comes from ClinicalTrials.gov participation data in OnCo's graph. The new records for this page are the Cuenta de Alto Costo, the Ministry, ADRES, INVIMA, the IETS, the Cali registry and one paper; the national cancer institute, the hospitals, the cancer league and the people were already in OnCo.",
  verify:
    "Incidence figures are modelled national estimates for 2017 to 2021, not counts, and the Cuenta de Alto Costo's figures are cases reported by insurers. Evaluation times are the limits set in the decrees, not measured times. The benefit plan and the MIPRES rules are set by Ministry resolutions that are replaced from time to time; the ones read here are for 2026. Before relying on whether a cancer medicine is covered, ask the insurer (EPS) whether it is funded by the capitation or must be prescribed through MIPRES, and keep a copy of any refusal in writing.",
