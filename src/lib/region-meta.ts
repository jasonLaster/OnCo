/**
 * The seven regulatory regions and their regulators: the small part of src/data/regional-approvals.ts that the
 * header's country switcher (src/lib/region.tsx) needs. It lives apart so the root layout, which ships with every
 * page, does not reach the approvals table itself (about 94 KB of source and growing with each data round).
 * src/data/regional-approvals.ts re-exports these, so existing imports from there are unchanged.
