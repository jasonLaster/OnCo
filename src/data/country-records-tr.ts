    summary: "The Kanser Dairesi Başkanlığı sits within the Ministry of Health's General Directorate of Public Health in Ankara (Bilkent campus, Üniversiteler Mahallesi, Şehit Mehmet Bayraktar Caddesi No:3, Çankaya). Its published duties include planning and running preventive cancer services, developing the cancer screening and registration systems, setting the national cancer screening standards, coordinating screening between family doctors and the Cancer Early Diagnosis, Screening and Training Centres (KETEM), collecting and checking the quality of all cancer statistics, and running the National Cancer Advisory Board. Cancer became a notifiable disease in Türkiye in 1982 and the department's predecessor, the Kanserle Savaş Daire Başkanlığı, was founded in 1983.\n\nRegistration: active, population-based registration began in İzmir in 1992 and, according to the department's 2020 statistics report, had started in all 81 provinces from the 2013 reference year. Certified registry staff collect cases from every public, university and private hospital, laboratory and death certificate in a province; the provincial databases are merged into a national data pool in Ankara. The annual Türkiye Kanser İstatistikleri report uses the 14 provinces whose data pass quality checks, covering 50.6% of the population in 2020, and scales their rates to the national population: 223,087 new cancers in 2019 and 195,581 in 2020, a fall of about 13% that the report attributes to people not seeking care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 report, published in Ankara in 2025, is the latest on the department's statistics page. Data from the İzmir, Antalya, Trabzon, Edirne, Bursa, Erzurum, Eskişehir, Samsun, Malatya and Gaziantep registries have been accepted into IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series, and the İzmir registry has been an IARC regional hub for cancer registration since 9 October 2013.\n\nScreening: breast screening offers a mammogram every two years to women aged 40 to 69, cervical screening an HPV DNA test every five years to women aged 30 to 65, and bowel screening a faecal occult blood test every two years and a colonoscopy every ten years to men and women aged 50 to 70. The department's list of screening centres, dated 29 January 2025, names 318 KETEM centres across all 81 provinces.",

    summary: "The Sosyal Güvenlik Kurumu, at Ziyabey Caddesi No:6, Balgat, Ankara, runs genel sağlık sigortası, the general health insurance created by Law 5510 on social insurance and general health insurance. What the insurance pays for, and on what conditions, is set out in the Sağlık Uygulama Tebliği (SUT), the Health Implementation Communiqué, which is amended by notices in the Official Gazette; prices for services are set by the Health Services Pricing Commission.\n\nFor patients the SUT sets a contribution of 10% of the price of outpatient medicines for people who receive a pension or income from SGK, and their dependants, and 20% for everyone else, plus a fixed charge per prescription, but no contribution on medicines given during inpatient treatment or on medicines in its exemption list (EK-4/D) when backed by a health report. Contracted private hospitals and foundation universities may charge an additional fee up to a limit the institution sets, but not for cancer treatment: radiotherapy, chemotherapy and radioisotope treatment are on the list of services for which no additional fee may be taken. Chemotherapy medicines on a separate list (EK-4/H) must be supplied by the hospital.\n\nA medicine is paid for only if it appears on the list of reimbursed medicines (EK-4/A), which SGK amends in numbered announcements (the 43rd of 2026 was published on 4 November), and only within the conditions the SUT sets: chapter 4.2.14 sets the rules for cancer medicines, including which specialists must sign the health board report. Use outside the approved indication needs a Ministry of Health off-label approval. A medicine not available in Türkiye can be imported for a patient through the Turkish Pharmacists' Association under a protocol with SGK, and paid for if it is on the foreign medicines price list (EK-4/C). SGK also makes alternative reimbursement agreements, governed since 12 May 2023 by a regulation that replaced one of 2016, under which a company can offer confidential discounts, budget or patient-number caps or a purchase guarantee in exchange for reimbursement.",

    summary: "The Türkiye İlaç ve Tıbbi Cihaz Kurumu was created as an agency of the Ministry of Health, with its own budget and legal personality, by Decree-Law 663 published on 2 November 2011; its offices are at Söğütözü Mahallesi 2176. Sokak No:5, Çankaya, Ankara. Unlike a member state of the European Union, Türkiye licenses medicines nationally, so a cancer medicine approved in Europe or the United States still needs a Turkish licence (ruhsat) before it can be sold.\n\nUnder the Beşeri Tıbbi Ürünler Ruhsatlandırma Yönetmeliği of 11 December 2021, applications can be made all year but the licensing process can start only in February, May, August and November, according to the agency's capacity. A completeness check takes 30 days; the licensing process is then to be concluded within 210 days, a clock that stops while the agency waits for information from the company and excludes laboratory testing and outside assessments. A Priority Evaluation Board can give priority or high priority to products that are first in treatment or diagnosis, bring an innovation, or are needed for public health, and decides which products may apply for conditional or exceptional licences. A 2022 amendment added article 37/A on reliance: the agency may take into account earlier assessments by other regulators with comparable standards, and for such applications the 210-day period is 90 days.\n\nA 2020 study of the agency's review process found that the median time from submission to approval for new active substances rose from 529 days in 2016 to 663 days in 2018, while the agency's own review time fell from 408 to 326 days and the time taken by companies rose from 137 to 268 days. The agency also authorises clinical trials and issues the off-label approvals that the Social Security Institution requires before it pays for a medicine outside its licence.",

Women were invited for screening with HPV DNA testing and conventional cytology collected at a single visit, so that triage (extended genotyping and the smear) needed no second appointment.
