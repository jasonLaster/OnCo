The first population-based registry started in Chiang Mai in 1986 and the first volume was published in 1993 with the International Agency for Research on Cancer. The institute also runs Thai Cancer Base, the registration software and dashboard that hospitals use, which the Ministry names as one of the electronic systems behind the Cancer Anywhere referral policy.\n\nThe coordinates on this record are the centroid of Ratchathewi district, not the street address.",

    summary: "The National Health Security Office manages the Universal Coverage Scheme (บัตรทอง, the gold card or 30-baht scheme), the largest of Thailand's three public health schemes (76.3% of the population in 2013, according to a 2015 study); civil servants are covered separately by the Comptroller General's Department and private-sector employees by the Social Security Office. It also funds health promotion and screening for all Thais whatever their scheme.\n\nThe NHSO's secretary-general reported in June 2026 that 633,866 people with cancer used gold-card services in fiscal year 2025, up from 357,737 in fiscal year 2021, with outpatient visits rising from 1,677,509 to 3,522,486 and inpatient admissions from 490,519 to 627,165. The Cancer Anywhere policy, announced by the Minister of Public Health on 11 November 2020 and in force from 1 January 2021, lets gold-card patients be treated at any hospital ready to treat their cancer. A revised version that was due to apply from 1 April 2025 was cancelled in February 2025 and the 2023 to 2024 rules restored, under which no referral letter from the registered unit is needed and the hospital bills the NHSO for radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, complications and other conditions the patient has.\n\nIn fiscal year 2025 the NHSO-funded faecal immunochemical test reached 1,387,573 people aged 50 to 70, and 1,414,771 women were screened for cervical cancer. In June 2026 the first lot of Imcranib 100, a targeted cancer medicine made in Thailand by the Chulabhorn Royal Academy, of which 690,000 tablets were granted to the NHSO, was delivered to the Government Pharmaceutical Organization's distribution centre for distribution to hospitals.\n\nnhso.go.th did not answer from OnCo's network on 4 November 2026; the figures are the office's own as reported by Thai news outlets, and the coordinates are a Bangkok centroid, not the office's address.",
