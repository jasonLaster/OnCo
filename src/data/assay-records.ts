/**
 * Assay registry rows (src/data/assays.ts) that describe the same product as a test record, so a readout page lists
 * the product once (src/lib/members.ts). Without this, the dMMR page listed "VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel" twice: once from
 * its assay row and once from the test record the mismatch repair rule gathers.
 *
 * Only one-to-one pairs belong here, each checked by name, maker and approval number on 3 November 2026. An assay row
 * that is one kit inside a family record (a therascreen kit inside `therascreen-cdx`, HercepTest inside
 * `her2-testing-assays`) is left out, so the kit keeps its own name. An assay naming exactly one test record in its
 * `drugs` resolves without an entry here.
