    "Cancer in the Philippines from Philippine sources: IARC's estimate of 149,852 new cancers in 2024 against 72,855 registered cancer deaths in 2023, the two Metro Manila registries that the national figures rest on, the 2019 cancer law, PhilHealth's Z Benefits including a breast cancer package of up to P1.4 million, the Cancer Assistance Fund and free cancer medicines at government hospitals, the FDA's reliance routes and the law's one-year licensing limit for cancer medicines, and outpatient screening tests paid by PhilHealth since August 2025.",
  lede:
    "The Philippines passed a National Integrated Cancer Control Act in 2019 that made cancer a notifiable disease, created a Cancer Assistance Fund and a national cancer centre, and treats people with cancer as persons with disabilities under the law. Every Filipino is enrolled in PhilHealth, the state insurer, which pays fixed packages for five named cancers and since August 2025 for outpatient screening tests, while free cancer medicines not yet covered by PhilHealth are given through government hospitals.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for the Philippines is 149,852 new cancers and 86,338 deaths in 2024, including 802 non-melanoma skin cancers (149,050 without them), an age-standardised incidence rate of 149.7 per 100,000 and a mortality rate of 88.5, with a 15.3 per cent risk of developing cancer before age 75. GLOBOCAN's incidence for the Philippines is built from subnational registry rates applied to the 2024 population (method 2b); its deaths come from trends in national death rates projected to 2024 (method 1). The country's own figures are lower and older. The latest national estimate from its registries that OnCo could read, the 2010 Philippine Cancer Facts and Estimates, projected 82,468 new cancers and 51,808 deaths for 2010, and its authors state that those estimates are based on GLOBOCAN 2008; a 2015 edition exists but could not be found. The Philippine Statistics Authority counted 72,855 registered deaths from neoplasms in 2023, provisionally, 10.7 per cent of all registered deaths; those are registrations without adjustment for under-registration, and deaths of Filipinos abroad are not included. GLOBOCAN's leading cancers are breast (28,124), colorectum (17,462), lung (15,312), prostate (9,195) and liver (8,638); lung leads the estimated deaths (11,715), followed by breast (11,160).",

Later provisional releases, as reported in the press, count 51,904 neoplasm deaths in January to September 2025 (11.6 per cent) and 64,864 in January to November 2025 (11.4 per cent), with a final report for 2025 due in January 2027. GLOBOCAN 2024 puts breast cancer first with 28,124 new cases and 11,160 deaths, colorectal cancer second (17,462 cases) and lung cancer third (15,312 cases, 11,715 deaths). GLOBOCAN estimates 7,829 cervical cancers. The 2010 Philippine Cancer Facts and Estimates, written by the Manila and Rizal registries, ranked breast, lung, liver, colorectal and cervical cancer as the five commonest; liver cancer was 7,331 of its 82,468 cases and is 8,638 of GLOBOCAN's 149,852.",

During the project the two Metro Manila registries were still collecting cases diagnosed in 2018 to 2022, the Cebu and Davao registries began collecting for 2023 to 2027, and a method was proposed for linking registry cases with the Philippine Statistics Authority's death records, which registries need to measure survival. The National Integrated Cancer Control Act makes adult and childhood cancer notifiable, requires every hospital and clinic to keep a cancer registry, and makes submitting its data to the Department of Health a condition of renewing a hospital's licence to operate (Sections 28 to 30). The Philippine Cancer Society says Manila registry data appeared in IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents from Volume VI (1983 to 1987 data).",

About a third waited more than 30 days and one in five more than 90 days, and a wait of more than 90 days was linked to a higher risk of death within five years for breast and cervical cancer.",

            "Among 20,654 patients diagnosed from 1990 to 2012 with ten common cancers who received treatment, 35.1 per cent waited more than 30 days, 25.2 per cent more than 60 days and 20.0 per cent more than 90 days; longer waits were more likely for patients aged 0 to 19, men, those treated at non-private hospitals, those with more advanced cancer and those whose first treatment was not surgery. Among 21,740 patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2017 and followed to 2022, a wait of more than 90 days carried a five-year mortality risk ratio of 1.09 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.04 to 1.14) against a wait under 30 days, with the association significant for breast and cervical cancer and for cancer that had not spread, not for metastatic cancer. These are the registry's own patients in Rizal and part of Metro Manila. A 2022 count of specialists found 348 medical oncologists and 99 radiation oncologists for almost 110 million people, with five of 17 regions having no radiation oncologist, which is part of the distance patients outside Metro Manila travel.",

            "OpenAlex, counting works whose primary topic is oncology and counting a paper for every country among its authors' affiliations, gives the Philippines 130 works in 2021, 113 in 2022, 133 in 2023, 131 in 2024 and 165 in 2025, 672 in total, of which 502 are open access and 16 highly cited. OnCo's OpenAlex snapshot of 8 September 2026 also records 1,353 ClinicalTrials.gov studies of all conditions with a site in the Philippines. Studies from Philippine data on this page include two analyses of the Rizal Cancer Registry on treatment delay (2025), the Philippine General Hospital's review of the colorectal Z package (2020), a national count of cancer specialists by region (2022), an extended cost-effectiveness analysis of the ACT NOW breast cancer pilot (2025) and an analysis of cervical screening in the 2022 national household health survey. The Philippine Cancer Society's Manila Cancer Registry and the Rizal Cancer Registry prepared the 2010 Philippine Cancer Facts and Estimates with the cooperation of the Department of Health, the University of the Philippines Manila and the Finnish Cancer Registry.",

The FDA's circular on the reliance routes was read from its PDF (scanned, read by OCR), while the base Circular 2022-004 with its target times could not be found, so the times come from the US Commercial Service.

The 2010 edition gives five-year relative survival for breast cancer in Metro Manila residents diagnosed in 1993 to 2002 of 59 per cent, which is too old to describe care today. The fund's appropriations in recent budgets, the number of access sites and patients served, PhilHealth's membership counts and claims for the cancer packages, and coverage of HPV vaccination after January 2025 were not found from a primary source. Whether the Philippine Cancer Center has opened, and whether the Health Technology Assessment Council has become independent of the Department of Health, were not confirmed.",

    "Every card was written from the raw text of Philippine sources: the National Integrated Cancer Control Act and the Universal Health Care Act (Lawphil copies), PhilHealth's benefits page, news release and Circulars 2024-0007, 2025-0014, 2025-0025 and 2025-0027, the Department of Health and Department of Budget and Management circular on the Cancer Assistance Fund and FDA Circular 2022-004-A (both scanned and read by OCR), the Department of Health's 2024 report on population-based registries, the 2010 Philippine Cancer Facts and Estimates, and the Philippine Statistics Authority's 2023 causes-of-death release (Internet Archive). News reports were used for events with no primary record OnCo could reach, and are named on their links. Papers were resolved through Europe PMC and their abstracts read. The trial count comes from ClinicalTrials.gov participation data in OnCo's graph. The new records for this page are the Department of Health, PhilHealth, the FDA, the Health Technology Assessment Council, the Philippine Cancer Center, the Rizal Cancer Registry and six papers; the Philippine Cancer Society and the Philippine General Hospital were already in OnCo.",
  verify:
    "The national incidence figures are estimates, IARC's from Metro Manila registry rates and the registries' own from 2010; the registered death counts are provisional and exclude Filipinos who die abroad. PhilHealth's package amounts and screening rules change by circular, so check the current circular and ask the hospital's Z Benefits coordinator what applies. Review times are targets as summarised by the US Commercial Service, not measured times. Before relying on free medicines from the Department of Health's programme, ask the hospital whether it is an access site and whether the medicine is on its list.",
