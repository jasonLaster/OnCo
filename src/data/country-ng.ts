    "Cancer in Nigeria from Nigerian sources: IARC's estimate of 152,261 new cancers and 90,795 deaths in 2024 against the few population-based registries that count cancer directly, a 2022 law that makes health insurance compulsory while most cancer care is still paid out of pocket, the national Cancer Health Fund and medicine price partnerships, NAFDAC and its reliance route, a new HPV-based cervical screening programme, 15 working radiotherapy machines for about 223 million people, and the trials in our records with sites in Nigeria.",
  lede:
    "Nigeria counts cancer directly in only a handful of cities, so its national figures are IARC estimates: 152,261 new cancers and 90,795 deaths in 2024, with breast, prostate and cervical cancer leading. A 2022 law makes health insurance compulsory, but most patients still pay for cancer care themselves, and the country had 15 working radiotherapy machines when international reviewers visited in 2024.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 figure for Nigeria is 152,261 new cancers and 90,795 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 113.7 per 100,000 (103.3 in men, 125.6 in women); the all-cancers figure includes the 3,177 non-melanoma skin cancers IARC estimates separately. It is a model, not a count: IARC's fact sheet gives Nigeria's incidence method as national or subnational rates scaled to regional all-cancer rates, and its mortality as national incidence estimates applied to modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios from registry survival data. The 2025 imPACT Review names five population-based registries (Abuja, Calabar, Ekiti, Enugu and Ibadan) as contributing data to these estimates. Those registries measure higher rates in women than IARC does in some cities and lower in others: in 2009 to 2010 Ibadan recorded 130.6 cancers per 100,000 women and 66.4 per 100,000 men, Abuja 138.6 and 58.3, and Calabar in 2009 to 2013 recorded 86.9 and 78.8. Their cervical cancer rates (36.0 in Ibadan, 30.3 in Abuja, 21 in Calabar) are above IARC's 2024 figure of 19.1 per 100,000 women, while breast is close (52.0 and 64.6 against IARC's 59.3). The registry rates are a decade or more older and cover a few cities, so neither set is a national count. NICRAT reports producing Nigeria's first national Cancer Burden Report for 2024, but its figures could not be found; see the gaps.",

Breast cancer is the commonest, then prostate and cervical cancer, and those three make up more than half of all cases. IARC estimates about six cancer deaths for every ten new cases in the same year, which the national plan reads as a high likelihood of death after diagnosis.",

Together breast, prostate and cervix are 80,904 of 152,261 cases, 53%. In men the leading cancers are prostate, colorectum and liver; in women breast, cervix and colorectum. The risk of developing a cancer before age 75 is 11.2% for men and 13.0% for women, and there are an estimated 292,934 people living within five years of a cancer diagnosis. Deaths divided by new cases give 0.60 for 2024; the 2026 to 2030 national cancer control plan, quoting IARC's 2022 figures of 127,763 cases and 79,542 deaths, calls its ratio of 0.62 an unacceptable level that points to a high likelihood of death after diagnosis. The plan also cites about 6,000 new childhood cancers in 2022, with approximately 95% presenting at late stages, and a 2024 study at one teaching hospital found 66.2% of patients with breast cancer had stage III disease or later at presentation.",

The plan reports that about 30 of 36 states provide some form of systemic therapy, mainly through teaching hospitals and private institutions in cities, and that 38 institutions in 24 states offer some paediatric oncology, four with dedicated wards. Molecular and genetic testing is not readily available, so specimens are sent abroad or to private laboratories, and out-of-pocket payment is the main way patients pay for pathology.

The 2024 National Cancer Registry Regulations made cancer a notifiable disease and created the National Cancer Registry of Nigeria, which the 2025 imPACT Review describes as 26 population-based and hospital-based registries; NICRAT's 2023 to 2027 plan had counted 34, with 13 population-based and 24 hospital-based, figures that do not add up as printed, and set a target of raising registration from under 10% of cases a year to over 70% by 2027. The review found most registries have no dedicated budget and that the last census, in 2006, limits incidence rates. In 2026 NICRAT reported training more than 100 registrars, accrediting eight registries, signing a three-year agreement with the African Cancer Registry Network and validating national registry procedures on 29 June 2026.",

Both self-sampling and provider sampling are recommended, point-of-care testing where feasible, and thermal ablation as first-line treatment, with triage by VIA or colposcopy for HPV types other than 16 and 18. On 14 October 2026 the Minister of State for Health listed the programme's first rollout in Owerri, Imo State, among the taskforce's achievements; NICRAT's 2026 report records launches in Imo and Niger States and about 20 women treated for precancerous lesions.

The review recommends that national guidance advise against routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing to screen for prostate cancer. NICRAT's 2023 to 2027 plan aimed for more than 50% screening of the eligible population by 2027, and its 2026 report records more than 4,000 people screened through community outreach, primary health centres and partners, and eight preventive oncology clinics. On prevention, the HPV vaccine entered routine immunisation in October 2023 as a single dose, a National Taskforce on Cervical Cancer Elimination was set up in August 2024, and hepatitis B birth-dose vaccination is part of childhood immunisation, with national coverage estimated at 67% in 2023. For the HPV vaccine the review gives campaign coverage rather than a national figure: 80% of the multi-age cohort in 21 states in phase 1 and 96% in 16 states in phase 2.

The 2025 imPACT Review counts 74 practising clinical oncologists, all trained in radiation therapy, six training programmes with 70 registrars in 2024, and 62 medical physicists against an estimated need of 150; it recommends reducing reliance on non-oncologists such as general surgeons for chemotherapy. The 2026 to 2030 plan records eight paediatric oncologists with specialised training, so general paediatricians treat children with cancer in most centres, and notes that surgical oncology residency and fellowship training has begun with accreditation by the West African College of Surgeons.

Because over half of people with cancer are estimated to need radiotherapy, it puts the need at more than 120 machines. Under public and private partnership arrangements at cancer centres in Enugu, Sokoto, Ebonyi and Lagos, with service contracts in place, machine uptime rose above 95% and waits for the start of treatment fell to an estimated less than one month; outside them, power cuts and the lack of maintenance contracts interrupt treatment.

    "Every card was written from Nigerian official sources and international reviews, read in full rather than through a summary: the Federal Ministry of Health and Social Welfare's National Cancer Control Plan 2026 to 2030; NICRAT's National Strategic Cancer Control Plan 2023 to 2027, its cervical screening guidelines, its 2026 activity report and its news pages; the gazetted National Health Insurance Authority Act 2022 and the NHIA's own announcements; NAFDAC's reliance guideline; the IAEA, WHO and IARC imPACT Review summary of September 2025; IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 fact sheet; and the registry papers through Europe PMC. Scanned documents were read by optical character recognition and load-bearing numbers checked against the page images. The new records added for this page (NICRAT, the National Cancer Registry of Nigeria, the NHIA, NAFDAC and four papers) carry their own sources.",
  verify:
    "National incidence and death figures are IARC estimates, not counts, and the registry rates are from a few cities and are more than ten years old. Insurance cover, subsidies and fund eligibility change by announcement and are not fully published; ask the hospital's NHIA desk or the oncology department what applies to you. Cervical screening is being rolled out state by state, so availability depends on where you live.",
