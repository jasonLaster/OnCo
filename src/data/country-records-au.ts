    summary: "Every cancer except basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin is a notifiable disease in each Australian state and territory: legislation in each jurisdiction requires hospitals, pathology laboratories and other institutions to report every case to that jurisdiction's central cancer registry. An agreed subset of those registries' data is sent to the AIHW once a year and compiled into the Australian Cancer Database, which runs from 1982. Deaths come separately, from the state and territory Registries of Births, Deaths and Marriages through the Australian Bureau of Statistics into the AIHW's National Mortality Database.\n\nThe AIHW's annual web report, Cancer data in Australia, is where the national figures are published. Because complete registry data take time to assemble, the report projects incidence and mortality forward from the latest actual year: the 2024 edition, released on 15 August 2024, was built on actual diagnoses to 2020 and projected 2021 to 2024, and estimated around 169,500 new cancers and around 52,700 cancer deaths for 2024, with five-year relative survival of 71 percent for 2016-2020. Its age-standardised rates are standardised to the Australian population of the report year, not to the World standard IARC uses, so they cannot be set beside GLOBOCAN rates. The 2025 edition, reported in October 2025, moved survival to 72 percent for 2017-2021 and estimated around 170,000 diagnoses for 2025.",
