Socialstyrelsen's register counted 73,861 people with a new cancer in 2024 (80,764 tumours) and the cause of death register 23,514 cancer deaths. Both include non-melanoma skin cancer: GLOBOCAN's all-cancers figure covers C00-97, and the register counts non-melanoma skin cancer other than basal cell carcinoma, which has its own register. They still do not measure the same thing: the register's rates are standardised to Sweden's own 2024 population; it records some benign tumours as malignant because of where they sit; and Socialstyrelsen estimates that cancers recorded on death certificates but never notified to the register would have added 4.8 per cent to its count in 2014 to 2022.

The register has run since 1958, reporting is a legal duty under the health data register law and Socialstyrelsen's regulations, and a notification is normally complete only when both the treating clinic and the pathology laboratory have reported. About 99 per cent of tumour records are confirmed by microscopy. In women the commonest cancers were breast (8,803 diagnoses, 1,328 deaths), non-melanoma skin cancer (5,420), colon (2,743 and 1,000 deaths), melanoma (2,671) and lung (2,511 and 1,965 deaths). In men they were prostate (10,782 diagnoses, 2,043 deaths), non-melanoma skin (6,760), melanoma (2,931), lymphoma, leukaemia and related cancers together (2,792) and colon (2,745). Socialstyrelsen notes that the fall in reported cases in 2024 probably reflects late reporting rather than less cancer: the latest year is revised upwards the following year. Basal cell carcinoma is counted separately, at about 50,000 people a year, and is not in these totals.",

For women aged 40 to 64 with breast cancer, reduced income was estimated at a little over 345,000 kronor, mostly from sick leave, offset by about 200,000 kronor of sick pay, sickness benefit and activity compensation, with about 21,000 kronor of added costs for care fees, medicines, dental care, aids and travel: a burden of about 170,000 kronor, about 135,000 of it in the first two years. For colorectal cancer at the same ages the total was also about 170,000 kronor. Above 65, where income is less affected, the estimated burden was about 35,000 kronor for breast cancer and 50,000 for colorectal cancer, mostly in costs. The sickness insurance ceiling in 2026 is an income of 600,000 kronor a year, so higher earners lose a larger share. About 12,000 people with cancer receive sickness benefit each year.",

        "Läkemedelsverket's website is built so that its pages do not render without running scripts, so OnCo could not read its own description of its performance, timelines or the Swedish licence route for unapproved medicines, and this page says nothing about them beyond the EU procedure. Socialstyrelsen's 2024 fact sheet publishes no survival figures, so the survival quoted is Cancerfonden's 2023 compilation from 2021 data rather than a register figure for a recent cohort, and no survival by stage is given. The interactive SVF statistics, which give results by region and diagnosis, are not read here; only the national annual report is. TLV publishes no threshold for cost per QALY, so the erdafitinib figure is one decision, not a rule. The full text of the 2026 cancer strategy, including any numeric targets, was not read; only the government's announcement was. Cancerfonden's annual research spending was not found on its site, and the figure in OnCo's country table was not verified. Europe PMC was unavailable on 3 November 2026, so DOIs were resolved through Crossref and PubMed.",

Karolinska Institutet is held only inside the Karolinska University Hospital record.

    "Written from Swedish sources read in Swedish: Socialstyrelsen's 2024 fact sheet and tables for the cancer register, its quality pages and its estimate of missing cases; Cancer i siffror 2023; the regional cancer centres' 2025 annual report on the care pathways, the breast cancer pathway in Kunskapsbanken and their screening pages; 1177 on patient fees; SKR on how care is financed; TLV's pages, one TLV decision basis and the ordinance on pharmaceutical benefits; the NT council's pages; Cancerfonden's 2026 household cost estimates; and the government's January 2026 strategy announcement. Every figure was checked against the raw text of the linked page or PDF; papers were resolved by DOI through Crossref and PubMed and their figures read from the abstract. The entity lists are drawn from the graph by id, with new records for the cancer register, the regional cancer centres, TLV, the NT council, Cancerfonden, the STHLM3 studies, the Nordic twin studies and four researchers.",
  verify:
    "Register counts for the latest year are revised upwards the following year, so check Socialstyrelsen's most recent fact sheet before quoting 2024 figures. Patient fee ceilings change with government decisions and a region may set lower ones; 1177 and the region are the authorities for what a patient pays. Pathway results and NT council recommendations change through the year. Nothing here is advice about an individual's care.",
