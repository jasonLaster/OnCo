  description:
    "Cancer in Malaysia from Malaysian sources: 168,823 new cancers registered in 2017 to 2021 by the National Cancer Registry, nearly two in three staged cancers found at stage III or IV, public hospital care for a nominal fee, the Ministry of Health Medicines Formulary that decides which cancer medicines its hospitals use, NPRA's 245-working-day review and its 90-day and 60-day reliance routes, HPV self-sampling for cervical screening, a cancer drug list being built for private insurance, and 171 trials with Malaysian sites.",
  lede:
    "Malaysia counts every cancer through one nationwide registry run by its National Cancer Institute, which registered 168,823 new cancers in 2017 to 2021, with breast cancer the commonest in women and bowel cancer in men. Most cancer care is given in Ministry of Health hospitals for a nominal fee, with the medicines they may use set by a national formulary, and the registry's sharpest finding is how late cancers are found: of those with a recorded stage, 64.8% were at stage III or IV.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Malaysia is 54,586 new cancers and 32,830 deaths in 2024, an age-standardised incidence of 140.85 per 100,000, including 591 non-melanoma skin cancers (53,995 without them). IARC's fact sheet gives its incidence source as a subnational registry, with subnational rates applied to the 2024 population, and its deaths as national incidence estimates applied to model-based mortality-to-incidence ratios from registry survival data, so neither figure is a count. The national registry's own figure is much lower: 168,823 cancers registered over 2017 to 2021, about 33,800 a year (31,688 in 2021), at age-standardised rates of 107.3 per 100,000 in men and 120.8 in women. The registry counts what is notified or found, and its editors say counts rose with the online notification system of 2018 and the mandatory reporting circular of 2020, that the lower count for 2021 may have been influenced by disruption during COVID-19, and that its data reflect the database on 31 December 2024; private hospitals supplied about 10% of cases. On deaths, the registry report cites 97,906 cancer deaths recorded by the Department of Statistics in 2017 to 2021, about 19,600 a year, 21.7% of them not medically certified, against GLOBOCAN's modelled 32,830. Both put breast, colorectal and lung cancer first; GLOBOCAN has prostate fourth, the registry lymphoma.",

The cumulative risk before age 75 was 11.9% in men and 12.7% in women (1 in 8 for both, against 1 in 10 men and 1 in 9 women in 2012 to 2016). Against 2012 to 2016 the all-sites rate rose by 21.2 per 100,000 in men and 19.2 in women. The ten commonest cancers were breast (29,719, 17.6%), colorectal (23,871), lung (17,028), lymphoma (8,793), liver (8,256), prostate (6,441), leukaemia (6,265), nasopharynx (5,186), corpus uteri (5,087) and ovary (4,714). Rates rose most for colorectal, liver, lung and prostate cancer in men and breast, colorectal, uterine and lung cancer in women; nasopharyngeal and bladder cancer fell in men and cervical cancer fell in women. The registry attributes the rise to both a true increase and better case-finding.",

The registry's Malaysian Study on Cancer Survival, published in 2018 for cancers diagnosed in 2007 to 2011, gave five-year relative survival of 82.3% for thyroid cancer, 73.0% for prostate, 70.6% for uterine, 66.8% for female breast and 56.8% for colon cancer, and 14% for pancreatic, 12.8% for liver and 11% for lung cancer; those are averages for people diagnosed 15 to 19 years ago, before most current treatments, and survival is higher at earlier stages. The registry's foreword names survival and mortality analyses as a priority.",

Review times are NPRA's targets except where a measured median is named. Fees and the PeKa Sihat benefits can change; ask the hospital which charges apply. Before relying on whether a particular cancer medicine is available in a Ministry of Health hospital, check the Medicines Formulary entry and its prescriber category, and ask whether special approval is possible.",
