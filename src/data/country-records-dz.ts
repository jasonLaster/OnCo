On 28 October 2025, at the network's annual meeting on its 2023 data, the INSP's director general gave 56,319 new cases recorded in 2023, and the health minister announced work to link the registries electronically to hospitals and laboratories. A national registry of cancers in children and adolescents, run by the INSP, has collected data since 1 January 2018.\n\nThe network publishes new cases, not deaths, and its own reports name no completeness figure for the country as a whole, so its totals are counts of registered cases rather than a measured national incidence.",
