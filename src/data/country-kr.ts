 * every card with its sources. Entity lists are pulled from the graph on the page by id so they stay in step with

 *
 * This page was written from Korean primary sources rather than from the corpus: the National Cancer Center's
 * national cancer information site (국가암정보센터, cancer.go.kr), which publishes the Korea Central Cancer Registry's
 * statistics and the screening programme's rules; the registry's own annual paper in Cancer Research and Treatment;
 * the National Health Insurance Service's page on the special co-payment scheme (산정특례); HIRA's own description of
 * the drug route; and the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's press releases and their attached PDFs, read with
 * pdftotext. Where a figure comes only from the Korean trade press it is labelled as such.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind while reading the numbers below:
 *  - incidence   Korea Central Cancer Registry, diagnoses in 2023, published on cancer.go.kr and in Cancer Res Treat
 *                2026. The headline rate cancer.go.kr leads with (522.9 per 100,000) is standardised to Korea's own
 *                2020 mid-year population; the registry's paper and the international comparison use the world
 *                (Segi) standard (288.6). The two are not interchangeable.
 *  - deaths      Ministry of Data and Statistics (국가데이터처, formerly Statistics Korea) cause-of-death statistics, as
 *                compiled on cancer.go.kr: deaths in 2025. The registry paper gives 85,271 deaths for 2023.
 *  - survival    five-year relative survival for cases diagnosed 2019 to 2023, followed to 31 December 2024.
 *  - thyroid     Korea counts and ranks thyroid cancer, which is the commonest cancer in the country; the registry
 *                publishes "all cancers excluding thyroid" alongside every total for that reason.

Half of new cases were in people aged 65 or over, and in 2023 prostate cancer became the commonest cancer in men for the first time.",
    detail: "The Korea Central Cancer Registry counted 288,613 new malignant cancers in 2023 (151,126 in men, 137,487 in women), up 7,296 or 2.5 per cent on 2022, at a crude rate of 564.3 per 100,000. Standardised to Korea's own 2020 population the rate was 522.9 (587.0 in men and 488.9 in women; one table on the same page prints the men's figure as 587.9), described by the National Cancer Center as flat, the growth in cases coming from ageing. Excluding thyroid cancer the count was 253,173. The leading sites were thyroid 35,440 (12.3 per cent), lung 32,953 (11.4), colon and rectum 32,610 (11.3), breast 29,871 (10.3), stomach 28,943 (10.0), prostate 22,640 (7.8) and liver 14,707 (5.1). In men the order was prostate, lung, stomach, colorectal, liver and thyroid; in women breast, thyroid, colorectal, lung, stomach and pancreas. 145,452 cases (50.4 per cent) were in people aged 65 or over. The registry estimates that a Korean who lives to average life expectancy (80.8 years for men and 86.6 for women, 2024) has a 44.6 per cent chance of cancer if male and 38.2 per cent if female. A further 38,204 carcinomas in situ were registered, led by the cervix (11,202), colon and rectum (8,540) and breast (7,032).",

After 2011 to 2012 the rate fell steeply as doctors and the public questioned the screening. It has crept up again since 2016, and thyroid cancer is still the commonest cancer in Korea.",
    detail: "On the world standard, thyroid cancer incidence went from 6.5 per 100,000 in 1999 to 50.7 in 2023. The registry's joinpoint analysis finds three phases: a rise of 22.4 per cent a year from 1999 to 2011, a fall of 12.1 per cent a year from 2011 to 2016, and a rise of 5.3 per cent a year from 2016 to 2023, while thyroid cancer mortality fell by 4.2 per cent a year from 2003. A national study using health-insurance and cause-of-death data found incidence of 46.6 per 100,000 in 2006, 115.0 in 2012 and 63.5 in 2015 with mortality unchanged, and found screening, diagnosis and post-operative complications all highest among the best-off, which its authors read as evidence of overdiagnosis. Thyroid cancer is not part of the national screening programme. It remains the commonest cancer in people aged 15 to 34, 54.1 per cent of all their cancers, and the largest group among the 2.73 million Koreans living after a cancer diagnosis (587,292 of them), and its five-year relative survival is 100.2 per cent, which is to say no different from people of the same age without it.",

Liver cancer has halved in incidence. Five-year survival from stomach cancer is now 78.6 per cent and from liver cancer 40.4 per cent, up from 58.0 and 20.6 per cent in 2001 to 2005.",

Two thirds of stomach cancers (65.3 per cent) are now found while still localised, when five-year survival is 97.6 per cent; found after it has spread, survival is 7.5 per cent.

Thyroid cancer, which almost never kills, lifts the figure a little: without it survival is 69.6 per cent. Lung cancer survival has more than doubled in twenty years, to 42.5 per cent.

The largest gains since 2001 to 2005 were lung (16.6 to 42.5 per cent), stomach (58.0 to 78.6) and liver (20.6 to 40.4).

Women with lung cancer now have 56.7 per cent five-year survival against 35.4 per cent for men. By summary stage, 46.1 per cent of cancers diagnosed in 2019 to 2023 were localised, with 92.7 per cent survival; 17.8 per cent had distant spread, with 27.8 per cent survival. 43.3 per cent of pancreatic and 40.7 per cent of lung cancers were found with distant spread.

Variation in approval delay was largely explained by submission delay, which the authors read as Korea not yet being a preferred first market for new cancer drugs. A new MFDS review procedure began in January 2025, with a dedicated team of reviewers for each product, early manufacturing inspection and scheduled meetings; MFDS reported the first biological product approved under it in December 2025 with an 18-person team. Trade press reported the procedure came with a fee of 410 million won per application and a target of 295 days against an average of about 420; MFDS's own text on those two numbers was not reached for this page.",

A nested case-control study of 16.6 million people in the programme found that people screened by endoscopy had about half the odds of dying of stomach cancer (odds ratio 0.53), while barium X-ray screening showed no association (0.98); the X-ray is no longer the programme's method.",
