    "Cancer in Viet Nam from Vietnamese sources: GLOBOCAN's estimate of 177,404 new cancers in 2024 against city registries in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, social health insurance covering more than 95.1% of people in 2025 and paying 80% of covered costs for most, a medicines list that asks for budget impact and cost-effectiveness evidence and a draft adding 30 cancer medicines, the Drug Administration's 12-month and 9-month registration routes, the 2026 to 2035 plan for breast and cervical cancer, and HPV vaccine in the national immunisation programme from July 2026.",
  lede:
    "Viet Nam counts cancer through city registries, the oldest in Hanoi since 1987, and publishes no national registry count, so the national picture comes from IARC's estimates: about 177,400 new cancers in 2024, with breast, lung, bowel and liver cancer the commonest. Social health insurance covered more than 95 in every 100 people in 2025, people with diseases on a Ministry of Health list that includes cancers can now go straight to a specialist hospital without a referral letter, and a new list of the medicines the fund pays for, adding 30 cancer medicines, was still in draft in late 2026.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Viet Nam is 177,404 new cancers and 111,015 deaths in 2024, including 1,987 non-melanoma skin cancers (175,417 without them), on a population of 100,987,690, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 142.4 per 100,000 and a cumulative risk to age 74 of 15.36%. GLOBOCAN's incidence for Viet Nam is built from subnational registry rates applied to the national population (method 2b), and its deaths are derived from those incidence estimates through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios (method 3c) rather than counted from death certificates. Viet Nam publishes no national registry count to compare it with. The city registries' own figures cover Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City: the Hanoi Cancer Registry's age-standardised rate for breast cancer in women was 40.6 per 100,000 in 2016 to 2020, against GLOBOCAN's 38.51 for the whole country in 2024. The Ministry of Health's own action plan shows how far routine reporting falls short of the estimates: the secondary reports compiled for its plan summed to 3,895 new cervical cancers in 2024, while GLOBOCAN estimates 8,274, and the plan calls the data incomplete and of uncertain quality. GLOBOCAN ranks breast (25,711), lung (23,085), colorectum (22,584), liver (14,591), stomach (12,373) and thyroid (12,223) first for new cases, and lung cancer (21,340) and liver cancer (13,664) first for deaths.",

GLOBOCAN also estimates 3,354 nasopharyngeal cancers. The Ministry of Health's 2026 action plan says more than 60% of breast cancers in Viet Nam are found at stage III or IV.

Until 2018 trained registrars visited hospitals each year to find new cases; since 2019 it has used active and passive, paper and electronic collection from 46 hospitals (42 public, four private) that diagnose and treat cancer in Hanoi, cross-checking new cases against health insurance numbers to avoid duplicates. A 2019 projection study used 2004 to 2013 data from the Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City registries supplied by the National Cancer Institute, and Ho Chi Minh City Oncology Hospital's doctors have published trends from their city's registry for 1996 to 2015. The Ministry of Health's 2026 action plan describes a national cancer surveillance and registration system that does not yet record people who were screened or had benign findings, and calls routine provincial data incomplete.",

The authors note that the 2012 expansion of K Hospital, which they call Vietnam's largest cancer centre, likely improved diagnosis and reporting. For head and neck cancer the same registry counted 19,589 cases (74% in men); the rate went from 10.9 per 100,000 in 1991 to 1995 to 18.8 in 2006 to 2010 and 11.8 in 2016 to 2020, and nasopharyngeal and sinonasal cancers fell from 68% to 21% of men's cases. In Ho Chi Minh City's registry the age-standardised rate of colorectal cancer rose from 10.5 to 17.9 per 100,000 over 1996 to 2015, faster in men (4.7% a year) than in women (2.6%), with rectal cancer rising fastest.",

Nguoi Lao Dong reported on 18 June 2026, from the ministry's reply to voters, that some proposed medicines costing 50 to 60 million dong a vial would be paid at 30% to 70%. On 26 September 2026 SGGP reported the ministry's reply to voters in Vinh Long: the list is being reviewed and amended, will add some new cancer medicines, monoclonal antibodies and immunotherapies, will set payment rates to suit what patients and the fund can afford, and would extend payment for 349 medicines to primary care facilities. No signed circular was found by 4 November 2026; until one is issued the 2022 list applies.",
