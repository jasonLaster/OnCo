/**
 * What a reader actually downloads, measured against the live site.
 *
 * Every page budget in the repo is on the static markup, because that is what react-dom/server can produce inside
 * vitest. `src/app/chrome-size.test.ts` says the assumption out loud: "the RSC payload cannot be rendered in
 * vitest, but the same trees drive both". On 25 September 2026 that assumption broke. `/timeline/` renders 528 KB
 * of markup, inside its 640 KB budget, and ships 2,138 KB, because the hydration payload is 1,610 KB on top. The
 * budget was guarding a quarter of the page.
 *
 * So this measures the exported page: total bytes, the markup, and the payload inlined for hydration. It is not a
 * test, because it needs the built site; run it against production or a local export and record the numbers.
 *
 *   npx tsx scripts/page-weight.ts                 # the recorded pages, against https://onco.cc
 *   npx tsx scripts/page-weight.ts --base http://localhost:3000
 *   npx tsx scripts/page-weight.ts /timeline/ /trials/
 *   npx tsx scripts/page-weight.ts --record         # write what each page weighs now into the ceiling file
 *   npx tsx scripts/page-weight.ts --check          # exit 1 if any page is heavier than its ceiling
 *
 * The ceilings live in `src/data/page-weight.json` and the weekly workflow runs `--check` against the live
 * site, which is the only place the real number can be measured. They are a ratchet: `--record` only ever
 * lowers a ceiling, and raising one means editing the file by hand and saying why in the commit. Measuring
 * without a ceiling was the whole problem; the markup budgets inside vitest have been green throughout.

 * that count has moved since.
 *
 * Added 7 October 2026, six days after the ratchet, because the ratchet was already wrong. Eight of thirteen
 * pages were over their ceilings and not one had got heavier per unit of content: the corpus had grown by a
 * thousand records. A check that fails every week for a reason nobody can act on is a check people learn to
 * ignore, which is worse than no check, and that is what the page budgets it replaced had done.
