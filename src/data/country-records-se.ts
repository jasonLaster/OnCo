    summary: "The Swedish Cancer Register is one of Socialstyrelsen's health data registers and has compiled diagnosed tumours since 1958. Reporting is a legal duty on everyone who provides health care, set out in the Act on Health Data Registers (1998:543), the ordinance on the cancer register (2001:709) and Socialstyrelsen's regulations HSLF-FS 2016:7. Where a diagnosis is made both clinically and morphologically, both units report, to one of the six regional cancer centres, which code and check the notifications before passing them on; the register is updated once a year. Socialstyrelsen states that about 80,000 malignant tumours are reported each year and that about 99 per cent of tumour records are morphologically confirmed. Basal cell carcinoma has been kept in a separate register since 2004, at about 50,000 people a year.\n\nIts headline for 2024, published on 4 November 2025: 80,764 malignant tumours in 73,861 people, 34,996 women and 38,865 men, with 11,372 women and 12,142 men dying of cancer the same year according to the cause of death register. Breast cancer was the commonest diagnosis in women (8,803) and prostate cancer in men (10,782).\n\nThe register's own quality report names its weak point plainly. Unlike most other national registers, including the other Nordic ones, Sweden has never followed up cancers that appear on a death certificate without a registration, so tumours diagnosed by imaging alone in older people, typically in the pancreas and lung, can be missing. Socialstyrelsen estimated the shortfall by linking the cause of death and patient registers: 3,958 cases a year on average over 2005 to 2022, 6.4 per cent of registered cases, falling to 4.8 per cent in 2014 to 2022 from 8.0 per cent in 2005 to 2013, and 12.3 per cent among people diagnosed at 80 or older against 2.7 per cent below 80. It notes that introducing systematic follow-up would probably need a change in the law.",

RCC's annual report for 2025 records 148,441 completed pathways across 27 diagnoses, against two national goals: that 70 per cent of new cancers go through a pathway, and that 80 per cent of patients in a pathway start treatment within its lead time. In 2025, 47 per cent did, up from 45 per cent in 2024; by treatment, 46 per cent for surgery, 35 per cent for radiotherapy and 50 per cent for drugs, and only acute leukaemia met the 80 per cent goal.\n\nThe centres also code and quality-check notifications to the national cancer register, host the national quality registers on the INCA platform, publish the national care programmes (vårdprogram) in Kunskapsbanken, and support the regions' screening and testing: the bowel screening programme for everyone aged 60 to 74, cervical screening with HPV self-sampling, the pilot lung screening studies, and organised prostate cancer testing (OPT), which began in two regions in 2020 and which Socialstyrelsen distinguishes from screening.",

The company must apply and must show the medicine meets the law (2002:160); the ordinance (2002:687) requires a decision within 180 days of a complete application.\n\nTLV's assessments rest on the ethical platform Sweden's parliament set for health-care priorities: human dignity, need and solidarity, and cost-effectiveness. Severity is graded on a four-step scale, low, moderate, high and very high, and the agency states that the more severe the condition, the higher the cost per quality-adjusted life year it is reasonable to pay; for particularly rare conditions of very high severity it may accept more. It publishes no fixed threshold, so the figures appear case by case: for erdafitinib in previously treated urothelial cancer, a condition TLV graded very high in severity, it estimated about 950,000 kronor per QALY against vinflunine and judged most of its sensitivity analyses below what it normally accepts at that severity.\n\nFor drugs given in hospital, which the regions buy rather than the pharmacy benefit, TLV produces health-economic assessments on request from the regions' NT council and takes no decision itself. Where regions and a company agree, TLV hosts three-party talks that can end in a side agreement under which the company repays part of the cost to the regions. TLV also works in the Joint Nordic HTA-Bodies, begun as FINOSE with Finland and Norway in 2018, and in the EU joint clinical assessments under Regulation 2021/2282, which began on 12 January 2025 with cancer medicines and advanced therapies; the health-economic judgement stays national.",

It states openly that it sometimes has to say no when the price is very high, because the money would otherwise come from care for patients with equal or greater need. Treatment councils can judge individual cases against a recommendation.

    tldr: "A study of nearly 45,000 pairs of twins in the Swedish, Danish and Finnish twin registers that asked how much of ordinary cancer is inherited. For most cancers the answer was a minor share: the environment, in the broad sense of everything that is not inherited, played the larger part.",
    summary: "Led from the Department of Medical Epidemiology at Karolinska Institutet, the study combined 44,788 twin pairs from the three Nordic twin registers, linked to the national cancer registers, to estimate the risk of cancer at 28 sites in the twin of an affected person, and modelled the relative contributions of heritable and environmental factors at 11 sites. At least one cancer occurred in 10,803 people among 9,512 pairs. It depended on twin registers and national cancer registers that can be linked person by person.",
    findings: [
      "Twins of affected people had an increased risk of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer.",
      "Statistically significant heritability was found for prostate cancer (42 per cent; 95 per cent CI 29 to 50), colorectal cancer (35 per cent; 10 to 48) and breast cancer (27 per cent; 4 to 41).",
      "The authors concluded that inherited genetic factors make a minor contribution to susceptibility to most types of neoplasm, and that the environment has the principal role in sporadic cancer.",
    ],
    whatItMeans: "It is the reason a family history matters for some cancers and not much for others, and it supports prevention: if most of the risk is not inherited, much of it can in principle be changed. The larger heritability for prostate, colorectal and breast cancer pointed at genetic risk that later genome-wide studies and polygenic scores set out to find.",
    caveats: [
      "Twin models assume identical and fraternal twins share their environment equally; heritability here means the share of variation in risk in these populations, not the share of any one person's cancer.",
      "Estimates for less common cancers had wide confidence intervals; the larger NorTwinCan study in 2016 reported higher estimates for prostate and breast cancer.",

    tldr: "Following more than 200,000 twins in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden for a median of 32 years, this study estimated that about a third of the variation in cancer risk is inherited, with higher shares for melanoma and prostate cancer.",
    summary: "A prospective cohort of 80,309 identical and 123,382 same-sex fraternal twin individuals in the population-based twin registers of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, followed through the cancer registers between 1943 and 2010. Time-to-event models estimated familial risk, the risk of cancer given that a co-twin developed it, and heritability, adjusting for age and follow-up and accounting for censoring and the competing risk of death. Karolinska Institutet's Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics was among the collaborating centres.",
    findings: [
      "27,156 incident cancers were diagnosed in 23,980 people, a cumulative incidence of 32 per cent.",
      "Cumulative cancer risk was 46 per cent (95 per cent CI 44 to 48) in identical twins and 37 per cent (36 to 38) in fraternal twins whose co-twin developed cancer, against 32 per cent overall.",
      "Heritability of cancer overall was 33 per cent (95 per cent CI 30 to 37); significant heritability was found for skin melanoma (58 per cent), prostate (57 per cent), non-melanoma skin (43 per cent), ovary (39 per cent), kidney (38 per cent), breast (31 per cent) and corpus uteri (27 per cent).",

    whatItMeans: "It gives patients and counsellors population figures for how much a twin's or close relative's cancer raises one's own risk, cancer by cancer, and it shows that for prostate cancer and melanoma inherited risk is substantial.",

      "Twin heritability is a population estimate under model assumptions, not a measure of any individual's genetic risk.",
