  description: "Cancer in Switzerland from its own sources: the Federal Statistical Office's count of about 50,800 new cancers and 17,200 cancer deaths in 2022, national registration made compulsory in 2020, basic insurance with a capped co-payment, the Spezialitätenliste and its 60-day rule, single-case payment for drugs not yet listed, Swissmedic's approval times, and the national trials group that was SAKK.",
  lede: "Switzerland is home to Roche and Novartis in Basel, and has recorded every adult cancer nationally only since a law of 2016 took effect in 2020. Basic insurance is compulsory and caps what a patient pays, but a new drug is paid for only once the federal health office lists it, and doctors and insurers have a legal route for the months in between.",
  globocanNote: "GLOBOCAN 2024's estimate for Switzerland is 56,828 new cancers and 19,408 deaths for 2024. Its all-cancers total includes 7,417 non-melanoma skin cancers, which the Swiss national count leaves out; without them GLOBOCAN's figure is 49,411, between the Federal Statistical Office's 2018-2022 annual average of 48,137 and its single-year 2022 count of 50,834. The Swiss office counted 17,220 cancer deaths in 2022, from its own cause-of-death statistics; OnCo could not establish from either source why GLOBOCAN's death estimate is about 2,200 higher, beyond the two years being different. The office's own world-standardised rates for 2018-2022, 271.8 new cancers and 74.4 deaths per 100,000, are the ones to set beside the ASR column here, remembering that GLOBOCAN's all-cancers rate includes non-melanoma skin cancer and the office's does not; its headline rates use the 1976 European standard and are not comparable.",

Averaged over 2018-2022, the open data put the commonest cancers at about 8,300 prostate cancers a year, 6,760 breast cancers in women, 5,060 lung, 4,560 colorectal and 3,510 melanomas. The median age at diagnosis was 70 for all cancers, and 64 for breast cancer. Lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths, about 3,260 a year; breast cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death in women, at 17.6 per cent of women's cancer deaths.

By 2018-2022 registries covered 98.3 per cent of the population. Since a federal law took effect in 2020, every canton is covered and every cancer must be reported.",
          detail: "The office's methods note (2026) sets out how a national figure is made: observed cases are weighted up by the ratio of total population to registered population, stratified by age, sex and language region, to compensate for cantons or years without registration. The share of the population covered was 55.3 per cent in 1993-1997, 67.4 per cent in 2008-2012, 91.6 per cent in 2013-2017 and 98.3 per cent in 2018-2022; the French- and Italian-speaking cantons have been fully covered since 2006 and the German-speaking ones since 2020. The first registry opened in Basel in 1969 (electronic data from 1981), followed by Geneva in 1970 and Vaud and Neuchâtel in 1974; Bern began in 2014, Solothurn in 2019, and Schwyz and Schaffhausen joined on 1 January 2020. The note also records quality limits: in the Basel registry, linkage with death certificates was complete only from 2013, and for Zurich it is documented only from 1997; whether it was complete for 1980-1996 can no longer be established. Children and adolescents under 20 are counted by the national Childhood Cancer Registry in Bern, about 252 new cases a year in 2018-2022.",

Bowel cancer has been falling since 2000 overall but slowly rising in adults under 50. Melanoma is common in Switzerland and still rising, while deaths from it have stayed stable.",
          detail: "The office reports that since 1993 lung cancer incidence and mortality rates fell by 31 and 48 per cent in men and rose by 72 and 40 per cent in women, with women's mortality no longer rising between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022. Colorectal incidence fell by 21 per cent in men and 10 per cent in women between 1998-2002 and 2018-2022, and mortality by 45 and 41 per cent over thirty years. A 2026 national study on the NKRS dataset found the opposite trend under 50: of 96,410 adults diagnosed from 1980 to 2021, 6.1 per cent were under 50, incidence in that group rose by about 0.5 per cent a year, and 27.7 per cent of early-onset cancers were stage IV against 19.4 per cent at 75 and over. Melanoma incidence rose 78 per cent in men and 65 per cent in women over thirty years, and the 2021 Swiss Cancer Report noted that Switzerland's melanoma rate is above the average of the comparison countries while most other rates are low. Breast cancer mortality has fallen 44 per cent since 1993 and prostate cancer mortality 50 per cent.",

That had risen from 61 and 64 per cent in 2003-2007. These are averages across all cancers and all stages, from people diagnosed in 2013-2017.",
          detail: "The Swiss Cancer Report 2021 gives relative five-year survival for 2013-2017 of 63.8 per cent in men and 67.1 per cent in women (absolute survival 56.4 and 61.5 per cent), up from 61 and 64 per cent in 2003-2007; relative ten-year survival rose from 54 to 57 per cent in men and from 57 to 60 per cent in women. It attributes the rise in part to earlier detection, for example of breast cancer, and to better treatment, and places Switzerland in the upper middle of the international comparison. On 31 December 2017, 65,762 men and 62,781 women were living with a cancer diagnosed in the previous five years. Newer site-specific figures come from the NKRS: in 2020-2023, relative survival with prostate cancer was 97 per cent at three years, and observed three-year survival ranged from 98 per cent in the lowest-risk group to 58 per cent with distant metastases; the office's cancer report, which carries survival, appears every five years, and the 2021 edition is the latest OnCo found.",

Article 3 obliges doctors, hospitals and other health institutions that diagnose or treat a cancer to record and report basic data: name, AHV insurance number, address, date of birth, sex, diagnostic data and first treatment. The NKRS adds that reports are due within four weeks, that in-situ tumours, tumours of uncertain behaviour and benign tumours of the central nervous system and pituitary are reportable, and that breast, colorectal and prostate cancer in adults, and all cancers in children, carry additional data on predispositions and comorbidities. Article 6 makes registration conditional on the patient not objecting after being informed. Registration happens no earlier than three months after the report; an objection after that deletes the personal data, keeps the disease data, and applies for life and across cantons. Adults are registered by 13 cantonal registries, children and young people up to 20 by the national Childhood Cancer Registry, and the NKRS, run by the NICER foundation, pools and checks the data. Article 34 required the Federal Office of Public Health to evaluate the Act within five years of its entry into force.",

In breast cancer, 85 per cent of treatment decisions were made by a team of specialists meeting together. In prostate cancer it was 56 per cent, and the registry says some men are being diagnosed and treated who need not be.",
          detail: "The NKRS analysed more than 20,000 breast cancers and precursors from 2020-2022 against 38 indicators, and more than 35,000 prostate cancers from 2020-2023 against 32, published with Swiss Urology in September 2026. For prostate cancer, about 8,929 cases a year at an average age of 71 (the report's mittleres Erkrankungsalter): 76 per cent were found by opportunistic early-detection testing, 13 per cent incidentally and 7 per cent from symptoms; 35 per cent of men had surgery (or rarely HIFU), 25 per cent hormone therapy, 19 per cent radiotherapy, 20 per cent active surveillance and 4 per cent watchful waiting; 72 per cent of low-risk cancers went on active surveillance; 30-day mortality after radical prostatectomy was 0.2 per cent. The report concludes that care is broadly guideline-concordant, that avoidable overdiagnosis and overtreatment occur, pointing to low-risk tumours found in men over 80, and recommends restraint in PSA testing where life expectancy is under ten years, evaluating an organised programme like those for breast and bowel cancer, and discussing every new case at a tumour board. For breast cancer, 85 per cent of treatment decisions were taken at a tumour board, and in cantons with a programme, 34 per cent of invasive cancers and 52 per cent of precursors in women of screening age were found by the programme. Both reports caution that 2020 was the first year of compulsory reporting and of the pandemic, and treatment may be under-reported.",

          detail: "KVG Article 64 sets the cost share as a fixed annual deductible (Franchise) plus 10 per cent of costs above it (Selbstbehalt). KVV Article 103 fixes the ordinary deductible at CHF 300 a year and the annual ceiling on the 10 per cent share at CHF 700 for adults and CHF 350 for children, who pay no deductible. KVV Article 93 lets adults choose deductibles of CHF 500, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 or 2,500 in exchange for a premium reduction capped by Article 95. KVV Article 104 adds a contribution of CHF 15 a day to the cost of a hospital stay, not charged for the day of discharge or for children and young adults in education. One exception raises the share: under KLV Article 38a, a medicine whose price is at least 10 per cent above the average of the cheapest third of products with the same active substance carries a 40 per cent share instead of 10, which matters for tablets that have generics. The cap applies to covered care; costs the insurance does not cover, loss of earnings and travel are outside it.",

The core condition is that a large therapeutic benefit is expected against a disease that can be fatal or cause severe chronic harm and, for lack of alternatives, no other effective authorised treatment is available. The insurer sets the price with the company: for benefit-based cases the discount on the listed or foreign reference price is set by benefit category and is at most 50 per cent. Article 71d requires prior approval (Kostengutsprache) after consulting the insurer's medical adviser, a decision within two weeks of a complete request, reasons to doctor and patient for a refusal, and, for a rare-disease medicine likely to be refused without clinical trials, the opinion of a clinical expert.
