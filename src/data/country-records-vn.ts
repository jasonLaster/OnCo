Its Health Insurance Department gathers proposals, consults an expert council on safety, efficacy and health economics, and must review the list at least every two years; insurance pays for cancer medicines when they are prescribed by doctors licensed in oncology, nuclear medicine or haematology at a facility approved to treat cancer.\n\nThe list in force is the one issued with Circular 20/2022/TT-BYT, which the ministry describes as holding 1,037 chemical and biological medicines, 76 of them for cancer treatment and immune modulation. In 2026 the ministry consulted on a new list that would add 84 medicines, 30 of them for cancer; in its September 2026 reply to voters it said the list was still under revision.\n\nOn 3 February 2026 the ministry issued Decision 358/QD-BYT with the national action plan on breast and cervical cancer for 2026 to 2035, which aims for 70% of women aged 30 to 49 to have high-performance cervical screening by 2035 and states that insurance does not yet pay for screening mammography or HPV tests. Its Circular 13/2026/TT-BYT, reported in June 2026, added HPV to the diseases covered by the Expanded Programme on Immunization from 1 July 2026. Politburo Resolution 72-NQ/TW of 9 September 2025 sets the ministry the goals of a free health check or screening at least once a year from 2026 and free basic hospital care within insurance benefits by 2030.\n\nThe coordinates on this record are approximate for central Hanoi, not the street address.
