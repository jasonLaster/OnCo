  description:
    "Cancer in Ethiopia from Ethiopian sources: IARC's estimate of 79,239 new cancers and 46,841 deaths in 2024, built on the one population-based registry in Addis Ababa, the Ministry of Health's 2025 to 2029 cancer plan, community-based health insurance covering about 65 million people, the Ethiopian Food and Drug Authority and its 2025 maturity level 3 rating, screen-and-treat cervical screening in more than 1,500 facilities, breast cancer chemotherapy in 30 hospitals, and why no trial in our records has a site in Ethiopia.",
  lede:
    "Ethiopia counts cancer directly only in its capital, so its national figures are IARC estimates built on Addis Ababa's rates: 79,239 new cancers and 46,841 deaths in 2024, two thirds of the cancers in women, with breast and cervical cancer leading. The country has gone from one comprehensive cancer treatment centre to seven, but treatment is still scarce and most patients are diagnosed late.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 figure for Ethiopia is 79,239 new cancers and 46,841 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 94.6 per 100,000 (69.8 in men, 118.4 in women), including 2,604 non-melanoma skin cancers. IARC's fact sheet gives its incidence method as subnational rates applied to the 2024 population, from a subnational registry: that is the Addis Ababa City Cancer Registry, the only population-based registry in the country, which covers about 3% of Ethiopians. Mortality is national incidence applied to modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios from registry survival data. So the national figure is close to the registry's own rates by construction: the registry measured 66.5 cancers per 100,000 men and 113.5 per 100,000 women in 2018 to 2022, breast cancer at 39.8 (IARC 40.8) and cervical cancer at 18.9 (IARC 20.2). The registry's earlier rate for women, 136.2 in 2012 to 2013, was higher. What neither can show is whether rural Ethiopia, where most people live and diagnosis is harder to reach, has the same pattern; the registry's authors read its low prostate and liver cancer rates as possible under-diagnosis. The Ministry of Health's 2025 to 2029 plan, quoting GLOBOCAN 2022 (80,334 cases), warns that the estimates are highly likely to underestimate the real burden.",

Breast cancer alone is more than a third of cancers in women, and cervical cancer is the second commonest. For every ten new cancers IARC estimates about six cancer deaths in the same year, and the Ministry of Health says most cancers are found late.",

            "The GLOBOCAN 2024 fact sheet gives 18,840 breast cancers (8,812 deaths), 8,159 cervical cancers (5,007 deaths), 7,372 colorectal cancers (4,108 deaths), 3,494 prostate cancers (2,134 deaths) and 2,967 leukaemias. Breast cancer is 36.0% of cancers in women and 23.8% of all cancers. In men the leading cancers by cases are colorectum (3,518), prostate (3,494) and leukaemia (1,615); by deaths prostate, colorectum and liver. The risk of developing a cancer before age 75 is 7.5% for men and 12.1% for women, and an estimated 142,431 people are living within five years of a diagnosis. Deaths divided by new cases give 0.59 for 2024. The Ministry of Health's Integrated National Cancer Control Plan 2025 to 2029 states that about 80% of cancer cases are diagnosed at advanced stages and that an estimated 12,000 cancer patients are treated each year; elsewhere it puts the share of cases identified at advanced stages at 70%. It counts an estimated 6,000 new childhood cancers a year, with survival of 20 to 30% because care is largely limited to national referral hospitals.",

The same list has 10 hospitals treating all cancers with at least one clinical oncologist and 13 giving breast cancer chemotherapy only. The Ministry opened the country's second radiotherapy centre at Jimma University Hospital on 20 February 2022, saying radiotherapy had until then been available only at Tikur Anbessa. The IAEA wrote in March 2024, after its imPACT Review mission of November 2023, that radiotherapy was possible at only three public hospitals, that waits were sometimes more than a year, and that five more radiotherapy centres were under construction in Addis Ababa, Gondar, Hawassa, Harar and Mekelle, one of them at St Paul's built through a public and private partnership. The plan says four centres are now equipped with linear accelerators, operational since November 2020, replacing two-dimensional cobalt-60 machines in use since 1999. OnCo could not confirm how many of the seven centres were giving radiotherapy in November 2026; see the gaps.",

The imPACT reviewers of November 2023 recommended complete coverage of the city so its data could be accepted in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, a Ministry budget line for registration, absorbing the registry's staff into Ministry structures, and making cancer a notifiable disease by law.",

The Ministry of Health's 2025 to 2029 cancer plan puts the premium at 921 birr per family per year and says members can use all services available at government facilities, but that because services are unavailable there, 60 to 70% of member families still pay out of pocket, including for medicines. National Health Accounts for 2019/2020 split health spending between donors (33.9%), government (32.2%) and households paying out of pocket (30.5%).

The national essential medicines list (6th edition, 2020) includes 54 essential cancer medicines; the imPACT reviewers recommended adding important oncology drugs such as anti-HER2 treatment for breast cancer, and oral morphine for palliative care.

The imPACT reviewers recommended allowing midwives to perform cryotherapy. In a review of 2017 to 2020 logbooks from 14 facilities in Addis Ababa and Oromia, about 13,800 women were screened by VIA and 5.9% were positive; over 90% of those were treated, but only about half returned for follow-up.",

The plan's baseline for full vaccination by age 14 is 80%, rising to a target of 90%, figures that differ from the WHO rows. For breast cancer, the plan's baselines are 35% of cancers found at stage I or II, 120 days to complete diagnosis and 30% of patients completing multimodality treatment, with 2029 targets of 60%, 60 days and 80% under WHO's Global Breast Cancer Initiative. The plan says Ethiopia has introduced screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer but gives no breast screening coverage figure; the imPACT reviewers recommended a national plan for breast cancer screening and suggested clinical breast examination for women aged 45 and over. Hepatitis B vaccine is part of childhood immunisation, and the plan reports over 85% of infants receiving three doses.",

Its goal is to reduce premature mortality from cancer by 15% by 2029, with four priority areas (breast cancer, cervical cancer, childhood and adolescent cancer, and other cancers including colorectal, prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and liver) and five pillars from prevention to palliative care. It is costed at 141,026,900 US dollars over 2025 to 2029: 46.75% for diagnosis and treatment, 18.03% for prevention, 10.45% for supportive and palliative care and 7.71% for surveillance and research; by category, medical equipment is 35.3% and medicines 23.5%. It sets a target of keeping stock-outs of oncology commodities below 30%.
