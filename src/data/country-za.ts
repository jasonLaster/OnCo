    "Cancer in South Africa from South African sources: IARC's estimate of 101,598 new cancers and 55,356 deaths in 2024 against the National Cancer Registry's laboratory count of 91,635 cancers diagnosed in 2024, the split between public care for about 85% of people and medical schemes covering 9.17 million with guaranteed cancer benefits, a National Health Insurance Act waiting on the Constitutional Court, the essential medicines list and SAHPRA's reliance routes, cervical screening and an HPV vaccine that cut infection with its two target types by 83%, HIV-associated cancers, and the trials in our records with sites in South Africa.",
  lede:
    "South Africa counts cancer mainly through laboratories: its National Cancer Registry recorded 91,635 cancers diagnosed by pathology in 2024, while IARC estimates 101,598 new cancers and 55,356 deaths that year, with prostate, breast and cervical cancer the commonest. About 85% of people rely on public health services, where an essential medicines list decides which cancer medicines are funded, while about 9.17 million belong to medical schemes that must pay in full for the treatment of most treatable cancers; a national health insurance law signed in 2024 has not yet taken effect.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 figure for South Africa is 101,598 new cancers and 55,356 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 161.5 per 100,000 (187.9 in men, 148.1 in women) and mortality of 87.9; the all-cancers figure includes 8,939 non-melanoma skin cancers (92,659 without them). IARC's fact sheet gives the incidence method as national or subnational rates scaled to regional all-cancer rates, and the deaths as trends in national mortality data held by the WHO, projected to 2024. The National Cancer Registry counts something narrower: cancers confirmed by a laboratory. Its tables for 2024 count 48,865 cancers in women and 42,770 in men, 91,635 in all; without the 24,512 basal and squamous cell skin cancers in that count, 67,123, against IARC's 92,659 without non-melanoma skin cancer. The gap is largest where cancers are often diagnosed by scans or examination alone: the registry counts 2,272 lung cancers against IARC's 7,693, and 10,769 prostate cancers against 15,060, while for cervical cancer (8,382 against 9,794) and breast cancer in women (11,264 against 13,338) the two are closer. The registry's population-based registries, which also count cancers diagnosed clinically, measured rates in 2024 of 134.4 per 100,000 women and 100.6 per 100,000 men in Ekurhuleni, excluding skin cancers, and the Ekurhuleni report puts South Africa's burden at approximately 90,000 new cases a year.",

Prostate cancer is the commonest, then breast and cervical cancer, and lung cancer causes the most cancer deaths. Before the age of 75, about one man in five and one woman in seven will be diagnosed with a cancer.",
          detail:
            "The GLOBOCAN 2024 fact sheet gives 15,060 prostate cancers (5,281 deaths), 13,338 breast cancers (5,377 deaths), 9,794 cervical cancers (5,165 deaths), 7,693 lung cancers (6,732 deaths) and 6,816 colorectal cancers (3,676 deaths). In men the leading cancers are prostate, lung and colorectum; in women breast, cervix and colorectum. The cumulative risk of developing a cancer before 75 is 20.4% for men and 15.2% for women, and an estimated 240,745 people are living within five years of a diagnosis. The National Cancer Registry's laboratory count for 2024 shows the same order in women, breast (11,264) then cervix (8,382), and puts prostate cancer first in men (10,769), ahead of basal cell skin cancer (8,732). Its childhood registry counted 3,032 cancers in children and adolescents aged 0 to 19 in 2022 and 2023, an age-standardised rate of 68.4 per million, with leukaemias, lymphomas and brain tumours the commonest groups; the report attributes the rise from 57.7 per million in 2019 to better case finding rather than more cancer.",

            "South Africa's National Cancer Registry, part of the public laboratory service, has counted every cancer confirmed by a public or private laboratory since 1986. That misses cancers diagnosed only by scans or examination, so since 2017 it has also counted every cancer in Ekurhuleni, near Johannesburg, and since 2023 in eThekwini, around Durban.",
          detail:
            "Regulation R. 380 under the National Health Act, gazetted on 26 April 2011, established the National Cancer Registry in law under the National Health Laboratory Service and made cancer reportable: a health establishment confirming a diagnosis must notify the registry within three months, and laboratories must report every quarter. Laboratories send cases diagnosed by histology, cytology or bone marrow, and the registry publishes counts and rates by sex, age and population group; its tables for 2024 were published in 2026. Because this method excludes cancers diagnosed clinically, radiologically or at death, the registry built population-based registries: Ekurhuleni, chosen because it includes all four of South Africa's main population groups, counted 4,914 cancers in 2024, the highest in its eight years, with 96.6% confirmed under the microscope; eThekwini counted 3,923, with 69.6% confirmed. The Ekurhuleni report says a cyberattack on the National Health Laboratory Service and a new patient identification system delayed case confirmation, so the 2024 total likely modestly underestimates true incidence; its discussion adds that the cyberattack disrupted both 2023 and 2024, that 2023 was artificially low, and that part of the 2024 rise, such as cervical cancer's rate jumping from 14 to 35 per 100,000, reflects retrospective back-capture of manual records rather than a true increase. The report says further registries are planned in the Western Cape and Limpopo but need a formal government funding commitment.",

A medicine already approved in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Switzerland, Japan or Australia can be registered through a shorter review that relies on that regulator's assessment.",
          detail:
            "SAHPRA's reliance guideline, SAHPGL-BAU-01 version 4 of May 2024 (first published in July 2019), describes three routes. An abridged review is based primarily on full assessment reports from a recognised regulatory authority; a verified review checks a product against one already approved by SAHPRA or such an authority; and recognition would accept the outcome of a review by an authority with which SAHPRA has a recognition agreement, which the guideline says SAHPRA was still negotiating. To qualify, a medicine must have been approved by at least one of: the European Union's centralised or decentralised procedure, Health Canada, the UK's MHRA, Japan's PMDA, Swissmedic, Australia's TGA, the US FDA, or a WHO-listed authority. The guideline follows the World Health Organization's definition of reliance, under which the relying authority remains responsible for its decision. A study of SAHPRA's approvals in 2020 found that approval timelines for applications in its backlog stream, assessed through facilitated pathways such as abridged and verification review, were 68% quicker for new chemical entities and generics alike; the abstract does not name the comparison, and business-as-usual applications all had a full review. SAHPRA also handles Section 21 applications, its route for access to medicines that are not registered in South Africa.",

Women living with HIV are screened irrespective of CD4 count and antiretroviral treatment, at three-yearly or annual intervals depending on the result, for life. The policy keeps cytology, introduces HPV DNA testing where resources permit and screen-and-treat with visual inspection in resource-limited settings, and set a goal of reducing invasive cervical cancer from 31.7 to 20 per 100,000 women by 2022. It noted that despite a national screening programme since 2002 incidence had remained unchanged, and gave screening coverage of women aged 30 and over as 54.5% in 2014/15 and 57.4% in the second quarter of 2015/16.

It states that screening mammography should not be introduced unless resources are available to screen at least 70% of the target group, women aged 50 and older, reliably and effectively, that lack of resources and infrastructure in the public system makes this untenable, and that mammography should be performed on symptomatic and identifiable high-risk women at specialist breast units. Women the policy lists as at increased risk, including carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 variants and women with a first-degree relative with breast cancer, should be encouraged to have yearly mammography from 40 to 50 and yearly or two-yearly from 50.

Cancer Alliance argued that the department had failed to use R784 million allocated by the Gauteng Treasury in March 2023 to address surgical and radiation oncology backlogs, of which R250 million for outsourcing radiotherapy was returned unspent, and the court found that the department had, without justifiable reason, ignored the patients' right to outsourced radiotherapy paid for from those ring-fenced funds; Spotlight reports the unspent allocation as the background to the ruling. It ordered the department to update the Cancer Alliance's backlog list within 45 days, take all necessary steps to provide radiotherapy to backlog patients at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital and Steve Biko Academic Hospital, and report within three months on its steps and long-term plan. The department appealed to the Supreme Court of Appeal; in August 2025 a judge ordered the March order enforced in the meantime, and the department said 563 patients were receiving radiotherapy through private partnerships and 1,076 had completed treatment by the end of July 2025.

  how:
    "Every card was written from South African official sources and peer-reviewed studies, read in full rather than through a summary: the National Cancer Registry's 2024 pathology tables, its Ekurhuleni and KwaZulu-Natal population-based reports and its childhood cancer report; the gazetted cancer registration regulations of 2011; the Council for Medical Schemes' 2025/26 annual report and its consumer guide to the Prescribed Minimum Benefits; the National Health Insurance Act 20 of 2023 and the Presidency's statement on the litigation; the National Essential Medicines List Committee's July 2026 tertiary and quaternary list and June 2026 trastuzumab review; SAHPRA's reliance guideline and 2024/25 Annual Performance Plan; the Department of Health's 2017 cervical and breast cancer policies; IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 fact sheet; and the papers through Europe PMC. Court proceedings are described from a law firm's summary and news reports, each named on its link. The new records added for this page (the National Cancer Registry, the National Health Laboratory Service, SAHPRA, the Council for Medical Schemes, the National Department of Health, five papers and one person) carry their own sources.",
  verify:
    "National incidence and death figures are IARC estimates; the registry's national count includes only cancers confirmed by a laboratory, and its full-count registries cover two districts. What a medical scheme pays depends on its rules, designated providers and formulary, and what a public hospital offers depends on the province; ask the scheme or the hospital's oncology unit what applies to you. National health insurance is not yet in force.",
