  lede:
    "Thailand counts cancer through provincial registries pooled by its National Cancer Institute, which estimate about 140,800 new cancers a year, with liver and bile duct cancer the commonest in men. Most Thais are covered by the gold-card Universal Coverage Scheme, which since 2021 lets a person with cancer be treated at any capable hospital without a referral letter and funds expensive cancer medicines through a restricted list built on cost-effectiveness evidence and price negotiation.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Thailand is 176,951 new cancers and 116,234 deaths in 2024, including 2,641 non-melanoma skin cancers (174,310 without them). GLOBOCAN's incidence for Thailand is built from subnational registry rates applied to the 2024 population (method 2b), and its deaths are derived from those incidence estimates through modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios (method 3c) rather than counted from death certificates. The national registry's own figure is lower and older: Cancer in Thailand Vol. XI estimates a mean of 140,799 new cancers a year in 2019 to 2021 (73,122 in women; the report gives 67,677 men in one table and 67,667 in another), with age-standardised rates of 137.6 per 100,000 in men and 132.9 in women against GLOBOCAN's 141.75 for both sexes. The registry figure counts other skin cancers (3,354 a year) and myelodysplastic disease (1,267), excludes in situ tumours, and covers 2019 to 2021, years in which COVID-19 disrupted diagnosis. The two agree on the order of the leading sites: liver and bile duct, lung, breast and colorectum.",

The report attributes a larger than projected fall in liver and bile duct cancer to the long-standing hepatitis B vaccination policy, screening of people with chronic hepatitis and liver fluke prevention; it records rises in colorectal cancer in both sexes, breast cancer and prostate cancer, which it links to an ageing population and modern lifestyles, and a continuing fall in cervical cancer it attributes to screening and HPV vaccination.",

Registrars collect cases from hospitals, laboratories and death certificates, match deaths to registered cases, code to ICD-O-3 and register but do not count in situ cancers. For the national estimate, each region's registries are pooled, age and sex specific rates are applied to the region's population, and the expected cases of the five regions are added to Bangkok's actual cases. The National Cancer Institute's own hospital-based registry, kept since 1985, counted 3,159 new cancer patients at the institute in 2025; that is one hospital's caseload, not a national count.",

They therefore need an authorisation system run by the benefit agency or a designated central agency, hospitals must monitor and record their use, and every health insurance fund is to develop financing so that patients can get them without a high financial burden on providers. The list is issued by the National Drug System Development Committee; the division's archived list of notices shows the latest consolidated list dated 4 January 2024 and an amendment of 30 August 2024. A 2015 study dates the special high-cost category to 2007 to 2009, when it came with compulsory licences, price negotiation, pooled procurement and company programmes, and estimated that patients treated with letrozole rose from 645 to 3,683 and with trastuzumab from 68 to 412.

Its 2012 survey of 4,320 people in 11 provinces, part of an Asian collaborative study with South Korea, Japan and Malaysia, found Thais willing to pay 195,000 to 325,000 baht for a year of life gained but 113,000 to 156,000 baht for a gain in quality of life only, and the brief recommends that the value should vary with the situation. A 2009 history by HITAP researchers traces how demands after 2006 to add expensive technologies to the public benefit package made health technology assessment part of national decisions. The 2026 comparison of cancer medicine lists calls Thailand's route a technical-negotiation model, using assessment-informed selection and price negotiation.

Six of the OCPA medicines were also on list E(2), but with wider indications: rituximab, for example, was payable in OCPA for diffuse large B-cell, follicular, mantle cell and marginal zone lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, against diffuse large B-cell lymphoma alone on E(2).

Target times in working days are: new drugs and new biologics 220 full and 154 abridged; vaccines 280 and 154; biological products 160 and 110; new generics and generics 135 and 115; and 90 for the World Health Organization prequalification and stringent regulatory authority collaborative procedures; where an application deviates from the reference approval, the deviations must be notified and, in the slides' words, the timeline will be reduced by 30% from standard review. The clock starts once a valid application is received and access to the reference regulator's confidential information is granted. The abridged route accepts unredacted assessment reports submitted and certified by sponsors, certified by Japan's PMDA, or sent by Australia's TGA with a letter of consent, and the Thai FDA reserves the right to perform a full assessment. Reviewers then weigh factors specific to Thailand: ethnicity and disease patterns, whether required gene tests are available, interactions with traditional herbal medicines and Asian fruits, Thai clinical guidelines and stability under tropical storage conditions. The September 2025 revision added pre-submission and pre-review meetings for abridged reviews.",

A 2015 study of targeted cancer medicines describes what happened around them in 2007 to 2009: the government created a special category on the national list with different coverage requirements for payers and issued compulsory licences, payers negotiated prices and pooled procurement, and companies expanded patient assistance programmes and lowered prices.

    "Every card was written from Thai sources read in Thai from their raw text: the National Cancer Institute's Cancer in Thailand Vol. XI (2019 to 2021) and Hospital-Based Cancer Registry 2025, the National Drug Policy Division's pages on the essential medicines list (Internet Archive copies), the Thai FDA's own slides on registration timelines, HITAP's 2015 policy brief, and Thai news reports quoting the National Health Security Office, the Minister of Public Health and the Comptroller General's Department by name, used because the NHSO's site could not be reached. Papers were resolved through Europe PMC and their abstracts read. The trial count comes from ClinicalTrials.gov participation data in OnCo's graph. The new records for this page are the National Cancer Institute, the NHSO, the Thai FDA, HITAP and two papers; the hospitals, company and people were already in OnCo.",

    "Incidence figures are modelled national estimates for 2019 to 2021 from 16 provincial registries, not counts, and the latest volume is the source to check. Review times are the Thai FDA's targets, not measured times. Screening ages and intervals are the NHSO's current benefits and can change each fiscal year. Before relying on whether a particular cancer medicine is paid for, check the current National List of Essential Medicines and ask the hospital which scheme and list applies.",
