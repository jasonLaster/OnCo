 * Unicancer's own pages, and INCa's annual clinical research survey. Every figure below was read from the raw page or
 * the PDF text, not from a summary of it.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind:
 *  - incidence  modelled national estimate for metropolitan France in 2023, projected from local registry data
 *               observed to 2018; invasive cancers only, skin cancers other than melanoma excluded; the prostate
 *               figure is for 2018 because the 2019-2023 projection was too uncertain to publish
 *  - deaths     CépiDc (Inserm) cause-of-death data for 2023, as quoted by the Panorama
 *  - survival   five-year net survival, age-standardised, for people diagnosed 2010 to 2015
 *  - rates      "TSM" is the world age-standardised rate, so French rates can be set beside GLOBOCAN's, but the case
 *               definitions differ (see the registry cards)

In women the leading cancers were breast (61,214 cases, 33 per cent), colon and rectum (21,370, 11 per cent), lung (19,339, 10 per cent) and pancreas (7,668, 4 per cent).

National figures are produced by statistical modelling of these registries' data. The estimates are made by a partnership of the Francim registry network, Santé publique France, INCa and the biostatistics service of the Hospices Civils de Lyon, which publishes a detailed study of incidence and mortality every five years; the 2023 estimate was projected from data observed from 1985 to 2018, and the prostate and thyroid projections were not published because their recent trends had changed.

The registre national des cancers (RNC) is to collect all cancer cases nationally, using nine main sources named in the implementing decree, at least eight of them annually, including the local registries, the national health data system (SNDS) and other national databases such as causes of death, emergency care and disability, and screening, clinical and biological data specific to cancer.

GLOBOCAN's all-cancers figure for France, which the table on this page reproduces from the 2022 release, is its code 39, all cancers C00-C97, which includes them. Both describe metropolitan France only: GLOBOCAN labels its entry 'France (metropolitan)', and the French estimate is for metropolitan France. They also refer to different years and are built by different models, and both are projections rather than counts. In the same 2022 file, GLOBOCAN's own count of non-melanoma skin cancer in France (its code 17) is 48,454, so its all-cancers figure without them is 435,114. IARC's fact sheet for France now carries the GLOBOCAN 2024 release instead, with 421,655 new cases in 2024 including non-melanoma skin cancer and 418,158 without it; the two releases differ in model as well as year.

    detail: "Under article R161-71-3 of the social security code and a HAS college decision of 23 June 2022, an economic evaluation by the Commission d'évaluation économique et de santé publique (CEESP) is required at listing when the company claims ASMR I, II or III and a significant impact on health insurance spending, defined as any advanced therapy medicinal product, or forecast second-year sales in the indication of 20 million euros or more, or a claimed impact on how care is organised. A budget impact analysis is also required under the 2021 framework agreement between CEPS and the industry body LEEM when forecast second-year sales exceed 50 million euros. The CEESP estimates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ratio différentiel coût-résultat, RDCR) and sends its opinion to CEPS as an aid to negotiating the price. The HAS pages on economic evaluation describe the ratio and its uncertainty but state no threshold value.",

The ANSM describes itself as the public body that gives access to health products in France and keeps them safe throughout their life cycle, with about 1,000 staff in Saint-Denis, Lyon and Montpellier-Vendargues; it authorises clinical trials, runs pharmacovigilance and contributes scientific advice through the EMA's working party. After European authorisation, a medicine still needs a HAS opinion and a price negotiated with the CEPS before it is reimbursed in France.

    plain: "Since July 2021 France lets patients with serious diseases and no good alternative receive a presumed-innovative medicine, paid for by the health insurance, before it has a reimbursed price, and sometimes before it is licensed. In its first four years 152 first requests were granted, 75 of them in oncology, and more than 140,000 patients were treated this way.",
    detail: "The 2021 social security financing law replaced the earlier temporary authorisations and temporary recommendations for use (ATU and RTU) with two regimes: accès précoce, decided by the HAS, and accès compassionnel, run by the ANSM. Early access requires four conditions: a serious, rare or disabling disease; no appropriate treatment; treatment that cannot be deferred; and a medicine presumed innovative. It covers medicines authorised but not yet reimbursed, and medicines not yet authorised whose company commits to apply, in which case the ANSM must first give a binding opinion on efficacy and safety unless the EMA's CHMP has already given a favourable one. The legal time limit for a decision is 90 days. The HAS four-year report, for 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2025, counts 394 decisions, of which 223 on first requests (94 before and 129 after marketing authorisation): 152 favourable (68 per cent) and 71 unfavourable. Of the 152, 75 were in oncology and 12 in haematology. The median time to decide a first request was 80 days, and medicines stayed in early access for an average of 17 months (510 days) before ordinary reimbursement. The HAS reports more than 140,000 patients treated, and that 80 per cent of products later rated ASMR I to III in the ordinary procedure had already been available through early access. A decree of 3 June 2026 (no. 2026-448), in force from 1 September 2026, led the HAS to revise its guidance and application forms.",

To keep it, it must discuss every patient's case at a multidisciplinary meeting, give a written care plan, offer access to tumour genetic testing and trials, and reach a minimum yearly volume for certain treatments. 826 establishments held an authorisation in 2024.",
    detail: "INCa describes the regime, defined in 2007 and recast by decrees no. 2022-689 and 2022-693 of 26 April 2022, as resting on three pillars: cross-cutting quality criteria, criteria specific to each treatment modality (cancer surgery, external radiotherapy and brachytherapy, systemic drug treatment), and minimum annual activity thresholds for some treatments and cancers. Authorised establishments must discuss each patient's file in a réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire (RCP), announce the diagnosis and the treatment proposal according to INCa's protocol and give the patient a personalised care programme, belong to a regional cancer network (DSRC), organise supportive and palliative care, favour access to innovative treatments and trials, and be, or cooperate with, a hospital molecular genetics platform recognised by INCa so that tumour genetic tests can be done. Every child under 18 must be discussed at an interregional paediatric tumour board, and suspected rare cancers must be operated on within the rare-cancer networks. INCa's argument for volume thresholds cites a 2014 study of 11,865 patients in which high-volume hospitals and surgeons improved survival in advanced ovarian cancer.

The person then declares neither the cancer nor the long-term condition status and is insured with no surcharge or exclusion. For people who do not qualify, the AERAS reference grid lists conditions, cancerous or not, that carry no or little excess risk and should be insured at or near the standard rate.
