    summary: "The Krajowy Rejestr Nowotworów is, in the words of its own bulletin, a separate organisational unit of the Maria Skłodowska-Curie National Institute of Oncology, State Research Institute, in Warsaw. Its legal basis is the 1995 public statistics act, the 2011 act on the health information system and the Minister of Health's regulation of 14 June 2018 on the registry, which also fixes the seat of a registration office in each of the sixteen voivodeships. Cases are collected in a central database, and almost 180 hospitals have connected their own systems to the electronic e-KRN system. Deaths come from death certificates collected by Statistics Poland (GUS).\n\nIts bulletin on 2023, published in Warsaw in 2025 with data as they stood on 10 October 2025, records 192,922 new cases registered (96,925 in men and 95,997 in women, ICD-10 C00 to D09, so including other skin cancers and in situ tumours) and 99,676 cancer death certificates (53,322 men, 46,354 women). It states that the incidence figures are still burdened with some under-registration and should be read as registered incidence; in 2023, 96.2% of cases in men and 96.4% in women were confirmed under the microscope. The registry has published national bulletins in PDF since 1990 and offers its own tabulations of data for 1999 to 2023 on its website.",

Under the benefits act the amount the NFZ pays for diagnosis and treatment given on a cancer diagnosis and treatment card (DiLO) is adjusted to need and to what was done, rather than capped. It also runs the oncology helpline and pays for the national screening programmes: its own figures for 1 November 2026 put coverage of the eligible population at 32.93% for breast, 16.66% for cervical and 17.62% for bowel cancer screening.",

It describes itself as an advisory body supervised by the minister that supports decisions on funding medicines and other services.\n\nUnder article 35 of the reimbursement act, when a company applies for reimbursement of a medicine with no reimbursed equivalent, the minister sends the file to the agency, which writes a verification analysis, obtains the position of its Transparency Council (Rada Przejrzystości) and issues the President's recommendation for or against reimbursement, within 60 days of receiving the documents. The analyses are published in the agency's public information bulletin. The act now also requires the agency to take account of joint clinical assessments published under the EU health technology assessment regulation. From November 2020 it compiles the lists of highly innovative medicines and medicines of high clinical value that can be paid for from the Medical Fund.
