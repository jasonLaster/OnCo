    summary: "The Cuenta de Alto Costo describes itself as a body of the health system created by Decreto 2699 de 2007, which obliges the insurers (EPS) of both the contributory and subsidised regimes and the other entities obliged to compensate to join together to deal with high-cost diseases. It runs as a self-managed fund that offsets uneven concentrations of these patients between insurers, and it measures and ranks insurers and providers on health results.\n\nSince Resolución 0247 de 2014, every insurer, special and exception regime, prepaid plan and departmental health authority must report to it once a year every person with an in situ or invasive cancer it attended. For its 2025 report, covering care between 2 January 2024 and 1 January 2025, 74 entities reported cases; 806,503 records were audited against clinical records, and the cohort analysed held 759,390 prevalent cases of all ages. It counted 69,571 newly reported cases, 64,840 of them solid tumours (60,713 invasive), and 38,262 deaths from any cause in the cohort; the age-standardised rate of newly reported cases was 108.96 per 100,000. The median time from clinical suspicion to a histology result was 35 days and from diagnosis to the start of treatment 51 days.\n\nIts survival report for cases diagnosed in 2014 to 2022 gives five-year overall survival of 76.69% for breast cancer, 75.31% for prostate cancer, 69.64% for cervical cancer, 51.25% for colorectal cancer, 25.15% for stomach cancer and 15.85% for lung cancer, with lower figures in the subsidised regime than in the contributory one for every cancer reported. Its 2024 paediatric report counted 13,772 people under 18 with cancer attended in the period and 1,406 newly reported cases.\n\nThe coordinates are those its own site gives for its office at Carrera 45 No. 103-34, Bogotá.",

    summary: "INVIMA grants the sanitary registration (registro sanitario) that a medicine needs to be sold in Colombia. Under Decreto 677 de 1995 a new medicine needs a pharmacological evaluation, a judgement on its usefulness, suitability and safety, which is reserved to a specialist committee (the Comisión Revisora, now its Sala Especializada de Medicamentos). The decree gives that committee 180 working days, with the clock stopped while the applicant answers questions, or 30 working days when the medicine is registered in at least two reference countries and has not been rejected in any; the reference countries are the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, France, England, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan and Norway. For biological medicines, Decreto 1782 de 2014 allows three routes, the full dossier, comparability and abbreviated comparability, holds them to the same standard, and gives INVIMA three months after a favourable pharmacological evaluation to decide on registration, which then lasts five years.\n\nSince Decreto 433 de 2018, an applicant for a new medicine also files a comparative dossier and its intended price, which INVIMA passes to the Instituto de Evaluación Tecnológica en Salud for a classification of therapeutic value in parallel; the result goes to the national price commission, and after 180 days without a final opinion the requirement is treated as met.\n\nIn March 2025 INVIMA adopted a six-month contingency plan (Resolución 2025010547) to clear more than 14,000 pending registrations and related procedures. In March 2026 the industry associations AFIDRO, FIFARMA and AmCham Colombia stated that 12,470 procedures were pending, that approval of new registrations had taken 29 months in 2025 against 22 in 2024, and that 45% of applications for new cancer molecules were rejected in 2025; those are the associations' figures, and INVIMA's own measured times were not found.

Decreto 433 de 2018 put this into practice for new medicines: the applicant files a comparative analysis of safety and efficacy against the comparators chosen for Colombia and its intended price, and the IETS classifies the medicine into one of six categories of therapeutic value, from significantly more effective than the comparator (category 1) to unclassifiable (category 6), and may add a cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis; for orphan diseases only the classification and budget impact are done. The question and the result go to public consultation and are published, and the assessment goes to the national price commission.\n\nThe Ministry's resolution updating the benefits paid from the capitation for 2026 cites a budget impact study by the IETS as the basis for the one inclusion it names.
