The phase 1b/2 first-in-human study NCT07287995 evaluates monotherapy and tumor-specific combinations. The registry, last updated 2 September 2026 and checked 6 October, lists recruiting status, an actual start on 5 February 2026 and estimated enrollment of 428. The earlier ASCO 2026 trial-in-progress abstract planned 196 participants; it is not an efficacy readout. No results are posted in the registry. Astellas lists the program in phase 1; the registered phase 1/2 design does not establish completion of phase 1 or demonstrated efficacy.",

Registration and a past estimated start do not establish that dosing has begun; current recruitment requires sponsor confirmation.",
