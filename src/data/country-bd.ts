  description:
    "Cancer in Bangladesh from Bangladeshi sources: the national cancer institute's hospital registry of 30,831 new patients in 2025, IARC's modelled estimate of 187,263 new cancers a year, a health system in which households pay most of the cost themselves, the regulator that says the country makes 98 per cent of its own medicines, the cervical and breast screening programme and its electronic register, and why the country has almost no cancer trials in the international registry.",
  lede:
    "Bangladesh has no nationwide population-based cancer registry, so its own cancer counts come from one hospital: the National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital in Dhaka registered 30,831 new cancer patients in 2025, most often with lung, breast or cervical cancer. Households pay most of the cost of care themselves, and the country makes nearly all of its own medicines, cancer medicines among them.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Bangladesh is 187,263 new cancers and 138,906 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 117.5 per 100,000. It is a model, not a count: IARC's incidence method for Bangladesh is code 5, rates based on incidence estimates or registry data from neighbouring countries, and its mortality method is 3c, built from incidence estimates and modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios. Bangladesh's own registry figures cannot be compared with it directly. The National Institute of Cancer Research and Hospital's registry counts only patients who reach that one hospital in Dhaka (30,831 new patients in 2025, 34.9 per cent of them from Dhaka division), not a defined population, so it gives the mix of cancers that arrive there, not a rate. The two disagree most on oesophageal cancer: GLOBOCAN puts it first in Bangladesh with 29,410 new cases, while the hospital registry ranked it eighth with 1,030 patients. Both put lung, breast and cervical cancer among the commonest.",

In men lung accounted for 3,574 (23.79%); in women breast 3,737 (23.64%) and cervix 3,632 (22.87%). 1,518 (4.9%) were children aged 0 to 18, with blood cancers commonest, and 6,713 (about 22%) were 65 or older. 69.9% arrived with a histopathological diagnosis, 9.2% cytological, more than 16% radiological only and 4.7% clinical only.",

For women it gives 238 ever smokers (1.51%), 86 (0.54%) current, and 5,701 ever chewers (36.07%), 1,365 (8.64%) current. The report summarises that men mainly use tobacco by smoking and women more often by chewing. Cancers of the lip, oral cavity and pharynx (ICD-O C00 to C14) were 2,683 patients, 8.7% of the total, and oral cavity cancer was among the ten commonest in both sexes (447 men, 599 women).

The director's message describes the registry as a vital source of information 'particularly in the absence of a nationwide population-based cancer registry'. The national cancer strategy of 2008 planned to extend hospital registration nationwide and named a population-based registry at Gazipur and a planned one by the oncology department of the medical university at Matlab, Chandpur and Mirsarai, Chittagong; OnCo found no published incidence figures from them.",

Its goals were to reduce incidence through primary prevention, ensure screening and early detection, ensure diagnosis and treatment, and improve quality of life through support, rehabilitation and palliative care. It reported, from the institute's and the medical university's hospital registries, that more than 66% of cancers occurred at ages 30 to 65, that about 20 to 25% were diagnosed at a localised stage, about two thirds when regional, and fewer than 15% with distant metastasis.

The Health Care Financing Strategy 2012-2032 had set a target of 32% by 2032. Households spent 64.6% of their health expenses on drugs, 13.4% on ambulatory providers and 11.7% at medical and diagnostic laboratories. These figures are quoted from The Business Standard's report of the launch, because the report itself could not be downloaded. WHO's Global Health Expenditure Database, as republished by the World Bank (updated 8 October 2026), gives out-of-pocket spending as 79.3% of current health expenditure in 2023 and 77.0% in 2020; the WHO series is a share of current health expenditure, which leaves out capital spending, and is WHO's own estimate, so it does not match the national accounts.",

For vaccines and biologicals already approved by a reference authority, the guideline says the Directorate 'does not review again' and registers them on the basis of that evaluation or a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product, and that a molecule registered by a reference authority in a given strength and form is considered safe and effective when a new drug is considered locally. The Directorate also takes part in WHO's collaborative registration procedure. Its 2024-25 report says it is working towards WHO maturity level 3, and it publishes no approval times.",
