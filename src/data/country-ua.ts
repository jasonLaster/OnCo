  description:
    "Cancer in Ukraine from Ukrainian sources: the national registry's 124,801 cancers and 44,545 cancer deaths registered in 2024 and how the full-scale war has damaged that count, the national purchaser's chemotherapy and radiotherapy packages, central purchase and managed entry agreements for expensive cancer medicines, the health technology assessment that advises on them, the fast registration route for medicines approved by trusted regulators and the new medicines law from January 2027, the screening order in force since 2025, free HPV vaccination from 2026, a measured rise in late diagnosis, and how few new cancer trials have opened since 2022.",
  lede:
    "Ukraine has counted cancer in one national registry since the 1990s, and its 2024 count of 124,801 new cancers was made in wartime, with parts of four regions occupied and many people displaced. The National Health Service of Ukraine pays hospitals for cancer care in yearly packages, the state buys expensive cancer medicines centrally and gives them to patients free, and since December 2023 cancer has been on the agenda of the National Security and Defence Council.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Ukraine is 153,699 new cancers and 82,596 deaths for 2024 (ICD-10 C00-97, including 3,970 non-melanoma skin cancers), an age-standardised incidence of 218.3 per 100,000 and mortality of 108.4; IARC describes its method for both as trends in national rates projected to 2024. The National Cancer Registry of Ukraine registered 124,801 new cancers and 44,545 cancer deaths in 2024, not counting Crimea and Sevastopol. Leaving out non-melanoma skin cancer, which the registry counts far more fully (14,528 cases against IARC's 3,970), the registry has 110,273 cases against GLOBOCAN's 149,729, so IARC's figure is about 36% higher; for deaths it is about 85% higher. The registry explains much of the gap itself: cases from the occupied parts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions are undercounted, and deaths are badly undercounted because regional registries lost access to death records, so that it registered 2.8 cases for every death in 2024 against 1.9 to 2.1 before 2021. It also publishes no rates per 100,000 for 2024, because there are no population figures for 2024 and 2025. The gap is not even across cancers: the registry's 9,934 prostate cancers are above IARC's 9,229, while for breast (13,966 against 18,344) and bowel cancer (15,109 against 21,007) IARC is well above the count.",

Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women and prostate cancer in men, where it has overtaken lung cancer. Lung cancer still causes the most cancer deaths in men and breast cancer in women.",

            "The registry's Bulletin No. 27 counts 60,397 cancers in men and 64,404 in women in 2024, 1,959 (1.6%) more than in 2023, and 44,545 cancer deaths, 25,094 men and 19,451 women. Most cancers were found at ages 45 to 74: about 75% of cases in men and almost 70% in women. In men prostate cancer was 16.4% of new cases (9,934, up 14.0% on 2023) and lung cancer 14.6% (7,882); the registry expects the long fall in lung cancer and rise in prostate cancer in men, visible since at least 2010, to continue. In women breast cancer was 21.5% of new cases (13,850). Thyroid cancer rose by 38.2% in men and 20.4% in women, and the registry says this may be a prolonged effect of the Chornobyl accident. Lung cancer caused the most cancer deaths in men aged 30 to 74, and breast cancer caused 20.1% of cancer deaths in women. The registry counted 579 cancers in children aged 0 to 17, three fewer than in 2023, which it describes as unchanged, but 35% fewer than in 2021, which it attributes partly to hospitals not reporting cases and possibly to wartime migration.",

It cannot measure survival for the same reasons.",
          detail:
            "Bulletin No. 27 states that cases have been undercounted in Donetsk and Luhansk regions since 2014 because of occupation, migration and the relocation of the regional registries and cancer centres, and that since 2022 similar problems affect many regions, most of all Zaporizhzhia and Kherson, large parts of which are occupied. In 2024 Luhansk registered 277 cases and Donetsk 1,049. It describes a substantial undercount of deaths since 2015, growing since 2019 in more than half of the regions, because registries lost access to data from the State Statistics Service and the civil registry offices; in Kharkiv the ratio of cases to deaths reached 10.3. With no population data for 2024 and 2025, the bulletin gives only counts and proportions. Late reports matter: the confirmed figures for 2024 contain 13,555 (12.2%) more cases than the first count. The registry concludes that it can keep only the count of new cases at a reliable level, close to 95%, and only a year after the year ends, and calls for its registrars to be given access to the national e-health system's data on whether patients are alive. The national strategy records that 22.3% fewer cancers were registered in 2022 than in 2021, with falls of 89% in Luhansk and 82.1% in Kharkiv regions.",

A population-based registry runs in every region, inside the regional cancer centre, and a hospital registry system is used in 26 of the largest cancer clinics, which pass electronic discharge summaries to the population registry; the whole country was covered by 2000.

Breast: population screening for women aged 50 to 69 and risk-group screening from 40, with examination and referral for mammography every two years. Cervix: population screening from age 30, a Pap or PCR test at least at 30 to 35 and then every ten years until 55, and every five years from 25 for women living with HIV. Bowel: a faecal occult blood test or faecal immunochemical test every two years for people aged 50 to 75, yearly for risk groups, with colonoscopy after a positive result. The order sets targets for family practices, such as at least 70% of people aged 50 to 75 tested every two years. The 2026 Programme of Medical Guarantees has the NHSU assess family practices each year on screening coverage for the three cancers.

    "Every card was written from Ukrainian sources read in Ukrainian from their raw text: the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine's Bulletin No. 27 on 2024 and 2025, the Cabinet of Ministers' resolution on the 2026 Programme of Medical Guarantees, the National Cancer Control Strategy and its 2026 to 2028 action plan, the 1996 and 2022 laws on medicinal products (read through Internet Archive copies of the legislation portal), the Ministry of Health's screening order and its annexes, the State Expert Centre's pages and its assessment of trastuzumab deruxtecan, and pages of the Ministry and the National Cancer Institute. Two figures from Medical Procurement of Ukraine are quoted as Interfax-Ukraine reported them. Trial counts come from OnCo's ClinicalTrials.gov records and a direct ClinicalTrials.gov count on 4 November 2026. The new records added for this page are the registry, the NHSU, the State Expert Centre, Medical Procurement of Ukraine and two papers.",

    "The registry's figures undercount deaths and cases from occupied areas, as it says itself. Payment rates and the reimbursement list are set each year and the 2026 resolution has been amended several times. The medicines law changes on 1 January 2027. Before relying on whether a medicine is supplied free, ask the treating cancer centre, which receives centrally bought medicines.",
