 * Several Australian Government sites refused automated requests that day: aihw.gov.au sits behind a browser
 * challenge, and health.gov.au, tga.gov.au and canceraustralia.gov.au dropped the connection. Their pages were read
 * from the Internet Archive's dated copies of the same URL, and each link below that depends on one says so and gives
 * the capture date. pbs.gov.au, cancer.org.au, the trial groups' sites and PubMed were read directly. Every figure
 * was checked against the raw page text or PDF, not a summary of it.
 *
 * Counting conventions worth holding in mind:
 *  - AIHW incidence is actual to the latest year in the Australian Cancer Database (2020 in the 2024 edition) and
 *    projected after that; mortality is actual to 2022 in the same edition and projected for 2023 and 2024.
 *  - AIHW age-standardised rates use the Australian population of the report year, GLOBOCAN uses the World standard.
 *  - Both exclude basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, which Australian registries do not collect.

    "Cancer in Australia, read from Australian sources: the AIHW's registry figures and how they are projected, what Medicare and the PBS leave a patient to pay in 2026, how the PBAC decides and the TGA approves, the four national screening programmes including lung screening from July 2025, the plan to eliminate cervical cancer by 2035, and the Australian work behind the HPV vaccine, venetoclax, PSMA theranostics and ctDNA-guided chemotherapy.",
  lede:
    "Australia counts by law every cancer except the commonest skin cancers in each state and territory, pays for most medicines through one national scheme with a fixed co-payment, and has four free national screening programmes, the newest for lung cancer. It aims to be the first country to eliminate cervical cancer, built on a vaccine whose particles were first made in Brisbane.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimates 224,864 new cancers in Australia and 54,551 deaths for 2024, with an incidence rate of 461.3 per 100,000 on the World standard. That all-cancers total (ICD-10 C00-97) includes GLOBOCAN's separate line of 63,903 non-melanoma skin cancers, which is a model, because Australian registries do not collect basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; without them GLOBOCAN's figure is 160,961. For the same year the AIHW projected around 169,500 new cancers and around 52,700 deaths, from actual diagnoses to 2020 and actual deaths to 2022, so GLOBOCAN's figure without skin cancer is about 8,500 lower and its deaths about 1,850 higher. The AIHW counted 147,500 cancers from registry data for 2020. The rates cannot be compared at all: the AIHW standardises to the Australian population of the report year, IARC to the World standard, and IARC's rate includes the modelled skin cancers.",

          plain: "The national statistics agency, the AIHW, estimated around 169,500 new cancers and around 52,700 cancer deaths in Australia in 2024. Prostate cancer is the commonest, then breast, melanoma, bowel and lung. About 71 in every 100 people diagnosed in 2016-2020 were alive five years later, against 55 in 100 in the early 1990s. These are projections built on the last complete year of registry data, which was 2020.",
          detail: "The AIHW's Cancer data in Australia 2024, released on 15 August 2024, gives around 169,500 cases and around 52,700 deaths for 2024 and five-year relative survival of 71 percent for 2016-2020, up from 55 percent in 1991-1995. Incidence for 2021 to 2024 and mortality for 2023 and 2024 are projections; the latest actual incidence year is 2020, when 147,500 cancers were diagnosed against 148,800 in 2019, the first fall since 1996, coinciding with COVID-19 restrictions and a month's closure of BreastScreen Australia. The age-standardised incidence rate rose from 582 per 100,000 in 2000 to an estimated 624 in 2024 while mortality fell from 255 to an estimated 194, and the AIHW attributes around 86 percent of the rise in case numbers since 2000 to population growth and ageing. Cancer accounts for around 3 in 10 deaths. Incidence is rising in people in their thirties and forties, from 121 to an estimated 141 per 100,000 and from 280 to 323 respectively, driven in the thirties most by colorectal and thyroid cancer and in the forties by thyroid, breast, prostate, colorectal and kidney cancer, while mortality in both groups has fallen. The AIHW's 2025 edition, reported by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in October 2025, moved survival to 72 percent for 2017-2021 and estimated around 170,000 new cases for 2025; we could not read that edition directly (see the gaps below).",

Rates are still rising in people over 50 but have been falling in people under 40 since the late 1990s, and deaths have fallen since 2013. About 94 in every 100 people diagnosed in 2016-2020 were alive five years later.",

Incidence in people under 40 has been falling since the late 1990s, and the AIHW links that to the Slip Slop Slap sun-protection campaign of the early 1980s: people now under 40 were born after or around it. Age-standardised mortality peaked at 8.0 per 100,000 in 2013 and is estimated at 4.9 in 2024, with deaths falling from 1,625 to an estimated 1,340.

Bowel cancer has fallen more than any other cancer since 2000, but it is becoming more common in people under 50, and free bowel screening now starts at 45.",

Colorectal cancer was the most diagnosed cancer at the turn of the century and is estimated fourth in 2024, at around 15,500 cases; its age-standardised incidence peaked at 86 per 100,000 in 2001 and is estimated at 57 in 2024, and mortality fell from 35 to an estimated 19 per 100,000.

Once a year each registry sends an agreed set of data to the AIHW in Canberra, which builds the national picture. The one big exception is the commonest skin cancers, basal and squamous cell carcinoma, which are not reported anywhere.",
          detail: "The AIHW's technical notes state that all forms of cancer except basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin are notifiable diseases in each state and territory, with legislation in each jurisdiction requiring hospitals, pathology laboratories and other institutions to report every case to the jurisdiction's central cancer registry; an agreed subset of the registries' data goes to the AIHW annually and is compiled into the Australian Cancer Database, which starts in 1982. Deaths come through a separate route, from each state's Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages and the National Coronial Information System, coded by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and held in the National Mortality Database. The AIHW warns that registry records change as late information arrives, so a year's count can move between editions and may not match a state's own report; one edition explicitly did not estimate late registrations, so its latest year may understate incidence. Because full data take time to assemble, every headline figure for the current year is a projection, and the 2024 edition projected incidence from 2021 onwards. The AIHW also classifies cancers as rare (fewer than 6 cases per 100,000 a year), less common or common; rare and less common cancers together made up an estimated 24 percent of cases but 33 percent of cancer deaths in 2024.",

If you are treated as a public patient in a public hospital, Medicare covers all your medical expenses. Outside hospital, Medicare pays the full schedule fee for a GP and 85 percent for a specialist, and the doctor may charge more. Many people with cancer meet those gaps, so it is worth asking what a consultation will cost before you book it.",
          detail: "The health department's pages state that Medicare covers all medical expenses for a public patient in hospital. A private patient in a public hospital pays for accommodation, theatre and doctors' fees, with Medicare subsidising the doctors' fees; in a private hospital Medicare pays 75 percent of the schedule fee, insurers at least 25 percent, and anything above the schedule fee falls to the patient or the insurer. Outside hospital Medicare pays 100 percent of the schedule fee for a GP and 85 percent for a specialist; when a doctor bulk bills the patient pays nothing, otherwise the patient pays the difference. Three safety nets limit what accumulates in a calendar year for out-of-hospital MBS services: the Greatest Permissible Gap, $104.50 from 1 November 2025, which caps the gap on any item with a schedule fee of $697.00 or more (the department indexes it each 1 November, and we could not read the amount set from 1 November 2026); the Original Medicare Safety Net, which after $594.40 of gap expenses in 2026 lifts the rebate to 100 percent of the schedule fee; and the Extended Medicare Safety Net, which after $2,699.10 of out-of-pocket costs in 2026, or $861.20 for concession card holders and families receiving Family Tax Benefit Part A, covers up to 80 percent of further out-of-pocket costs, subject to caps on some items.

After $1,748.20 in a year, or $277.20 with a concession card, the safety net makes further PBS medicines cheaper or free. Many chemotherapy drugs are given only in hospitals and specialist services because they need medical supervision.",

The general co-payment will be indexed to the Consumer Price Index each January from 2027; the concessional co-payment stays at $7.70 until 2029 and is indexed from 2030.

Two sub-committees support it, the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee and the Economics Sub-Committee, with a working party.

A new medicine usually takes up to about eleven months to review. Priority review aims to finish up to three months sooner, using the same amount of evidence. Provisional approval lets a promising medicine for a serious condition be used up to two years earlier, on early data, while the company finishes its trials.",
          detail: "The legislated timeframe for a new prescription medicine is 255 working days for evaluation and decision, after 40 working days to pass preliminary assessment. The priority review pathway has a target of 150 working days on the same evidence as a standard application, and is reserved for medicines for serious and life-threatening conditions that are a major advance. Provisional registration has the same 255-day legislated timeframe but rests on preliminary clinical data and a plan to collect confirmatory data; it lasts two years, can be extended twice to a maximum of six, and lapses if not converted to full registration. Australia is not part of the European system, but the TGA can rely on a comparable overseas regulator's assessment report: under COR-A, where nothing beyond the Australian label, Product Information and risk management plan needs evaluating, the timeframe is 120 working days; under COR-B, with some additional data, 175. The regulators whose reports it accepts include the European Medicines Agency, the FDA, Health Canada, Japan's PMDA, Singapore's HSA, Swissmedic and the UK's MHRA. The TGA is also a member of the Access Consortium with Canada, Singapore, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, formed in 2007 as ACSS and renamed when the MHRA joined in October 2020, and has been a partner in the FDA's Project Orbis for cancer medicines since May 2019.",

Six provisional determinations were granted from seven applications, against fifteen from fifteen the year before, and 13 provisional registrations were approved with a median of 180 working days. Seventeen orphan drug registrations were approved, with a median of 175.5 working days, and orphan designation brings a 100 percent waiver of TGA fees. Through Project Orbis the TGA had approved approximately 25 new medicines and 35 new indications by 30 September 2023, well over half of them through the priority or provisional pathway. These are working days, which exclude the time a company takes to answer the TGA's questions, so they are shorter than the calendar time from submission to approval.

The National Cancer Screening Register, expanded to cover lung screening by the National Cancer Screening Register Amendment Act 2024, sends reminders and results letters, and radiologists must report screening results to it within 30 days. The first of five mobile screening trucks run with Heart of Australia began visiting communities in the Kimberley and Pilbara in November 2025, with the trucks for the Northern Territory and Queensland scheduled from May and September 2026, and the department names equitable outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people as a key focus of the program.

The licensed vaccines use particles made from L1 alone, a step to which several laboratories contributed, including Douglas Lowy and John Schiller's at the US National Cancer Institute, which reported in 1992 that L1 by itself assembles into highly immunogenic virus-like particles. Jian Zhou died in 1999, before the vaccine was licensed. The University of Queensland's Frazer Institute carries the name. Gardasil 9, the vaccine now given in Australian schools, is in the medicine list on this page as a descendant of that technology rather than an Australian product.",

That role of BCL-2 was discovered at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne in the late 1980s, and the first human study of the drug was led from Melbourne.",
          detail: "The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute describes venetoclax as based on its discovery in the late 1980s that BCL-2 helps leukaemia cells live, and the drug as developed through a research collaboration between AbbVie, Genentech and the Institute, with clinicians at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. The first-in-human study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016 with Andrew Roberts as first author and John Seymour as senior author, treated 116 people with relapsed CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma: 79 percent responded, 20 percent had complete remission, and a weekly dose ramp-up removed clinical tumour lysis syndrome in the expansion cohort after it had occurred in 3 of 56 patients, one fatally, during dose escalation. Venetoclax with rituximab was listed on the PBS for previously treated CLL from 1 March 2019.",

TheraP compared the radioactive treatment lutetium-PSMA with chemotherapy.",

TheraP randomised 200 men at 11 Australian centres with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, for whom cabazitaxel was the next standard treatment, to lutetium-177 PSMA-617 or cabazitaxel: PSA response by intention to treat was 66 against 37 percent, and grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 33 against 53 percent of men treated.

Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne describes itself as Australia's largest cancer research centre with more than 700 laboratory and clinical researchers.

Each comes as a full pathway, a Quick Reference Guide for clinicians and a Guide to Best Cancer Care for patients (formerly What to Expect). Cancer Council Victoria, supported by the Victorian Government, refreshed 15 of them into second editions; the Leukaemia Foundation developed pathways for six blood cancers; there is a pathway for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with cancer, and one for people with disability is in development.
