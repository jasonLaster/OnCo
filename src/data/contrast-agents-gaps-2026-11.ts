/**
 * Contrast agents and surgical dyes, November 2026 round. Filled from the imaging-contrast-dyes rows of
 * docs/proposals/gap-census-2026-11.md: the gadolinium, iron, iodinated, barium and microbubble agents and the blue dyes
 * that Drugs@FDA and the WHO ATC index (V08 contrast media) list, with three family records that hold them together.
 *
 * Application numbers, sponsors and original approval dates were read from the openFDA Drugs@FDA endpoint on
 * 4 November 2026; indications are quoted from the current FDA label (openFDA drug label endpoint, or DailyMed where
 * openFDA had none); European rows from the EMA medicines register spreadsheet of the same date; ATC codes from the
 * WHO Collaborating Centre's index pages for V08CA, V08AB, V08DA, V08CB and V04CX. An original approval date is the
 * first approval of that application, not necessarily the first approval of the substance anywhere.
 *
 * Not filled, and why: patent blue V (ATC V04CX09) and iobitridol (V08AB11) have an ATC code but no regulator label that
 * could be read here; perflubutane microspheres (Sonazoid, V08DA06) likewise; fluorescein was left to its existing
 * mentions because its labels are for eye angiography.
