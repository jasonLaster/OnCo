    summary: "The National Cancer Registry Program of Egypt was established in 2008. Its published method stratified Egypt into Lower, Middle and Upper Egypt and set up a population-based registry in one governorate for each, Damietta in the Nile delta, Minya in Middle Egypt and Aswan in Upper Egypt, located in the Ministry of Health cancer centre of each governorate; the three covered 20.9% of the population of Egypt. Trained doctors abstracted records from the cancer centres, tertiary centres including the National Cancer Institute of Cairo University and the South Egypt Cancer Institute in Assiut, the Health Insurance Organization, the government-subsidised treatment programme and death records, with online data entry and the national identity number used to remove duplicates. Death-certificate-only cases were almost 8% of the total.\n\nThe programme's national report, published in 2014 for the registration years 2008 to 2011, gave an age-standardised incidence of 166.6 per 100,000 for both sexes, with liver (23.8% of cancers), breast (15.4%) and bladder (6.9%) the commonest sites, and projected 114,985 new cancers in 2013 rising to 331,169 in 2050 at the same age-specific rates. The authors write that the rates rest on a short initial phase of registration and a mathematical model that applies regional rates to the national population.\n\nOnCo found no later national incidence report from the programme, and no website for it; the coordinates on this record are a country centroid, not an address.",
