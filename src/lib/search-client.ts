/**
 * The browser-side search index: the exported /api/v1/search.json (every entity and page, one document each) inside a
 * MiniSearch instance, built once per page load and shared by the header palette, the search box, the search page,
 * Ask OnCo, the 404 helper and the WebMCP tools.
 *
 * It arrives in two stages. search.json is 9.5 MB (2.1 MB over the wire), and until it had loaded every list was empty,
 * which a reader cannot tell from "not found": the owner searched for a record that exists on 4 November 2026 and
 * thought it was missing. So the lists that answer as someone types (palette, search box, search page, 404 helper)
 * call `loadQuickSearch`, which builds a first index from /api/v1/search-names.json (names, aliases and the fields the
 * ranking reads, src/lib/search-names.ts) and then fetches search.json behind it; `onFullSearch` tells them when to
 * re-run the query on the full index. What needs the summaries (Ask OnCo, the WebMCP tool) calls `loadSearch`, which
 * is the full index only. A list says "Loading search…" until an index is ready, and never "no matches" from the
 * first stage, since a word in a summary can still match.
 *
 * MiniSearch itself is loaded with the first search rather than imported statically: the palette is in the root
 * layout, so anything it imports statically ships with every page, and the library is only needed once a reader types.
