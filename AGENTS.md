# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Working in this repository

OnCo is a public, cited knowledge graph of oncology: about 19,000 records in `src/data`, rendered as a static
Next.js export. Readers are patients and the people caring for them. Every claim carries a source, and a page
that is confidently wrong is the worst thing this project can ship.

This file is short on purpose: it is read at the start of every session, so it holds only what is costly to
learn the hard way and cannot be a test. Everything else is enforced or written down elsewhere, linked below.

## Never

- **Never invent a fact, a figure, a citation or a date.** If a source cannot be reached, say so on the page. A
  named gap is worth more than a plausible number. Tools that summarise a page can fabricate: a fetch of a
  ministry page produced "universal health insurance since 1961" from a page containing neither the year nor the
  phrase. Verify anything load-bearing against the raw text.
- **Never cite an identifier you remember. Resolve it first.** This is the commonest real error, and it is not
  invention: a DOI or PubMed id recalled from training is usually a real paper, just the wrong one. Caught in two
  rounds: an id for a surveillance-imaging trial that resolved to a cancer-anorexia editorial, one for a Hodgkin
  late-effects cohort that resolved to IBIS-II, one for a retinal-imaging study, `10.1038/ng.621` used for the
  lymphoma EZH2 paper when it is the myeloid one, and wrong ids for BELINDA and ECHELON-3. Resolve every DOI
  through Crossref or Europe PMC and read the abstract before you use a figure from it.
- **Never alter a quotation to make it kinder or shorter.** Quoted abstracts keep their authors' words.
- **Never put a secret in the repository**, in a commit message, or in a chat. There are none here and there
  should continue to be none; `gitleaks` runs on every ship and a commit subject is republished publicly by
  `scripts/provenance.ts`, so write commit messages as if they were a page, because they become one.
- **Never copy patient data, or anything from a private project, into this repository.**
- **Keep review screenshots and recordings out of the repository.** Capture them in a temporary directory
  outside the checkout and attach or link them in the pull request, including matching before/after views
  when reviewing a visual change. Product image assets belong in the repository; review artifacts do not.
- **Never run `vercel link` or edit `.vercel/`.** The project is already linked; relinking can point a deploy at
  the wrong project.
- **Never edit files in the main checkout while a ship is running**, and never run gates or a second build during
  one. `scripts/ship.sh` sweeps the working tree into its commit, and the upload packs `public/` while the API
  build clears part of it: doing both at once killed a deploy that had reported success.
- **Never ship a change to the product without the owner's say-so.** `scripts/ship.sh` classifies the diff and
  refuses if it touches anything that decides what a page shows, in what order, or what it is called. Data ships
  on its own; the product waits. Send it with `scripts/propose-product-change.sh` and it appears at `/admin/`
  with a preview. `docs/PRODUCT-APPROVAL.md` is the rule and `scripts/change-class.ts` is where the line is
  drawn. Do not set `ONCO_PRODUCT_APPROVED` on your own judgement, however obviously good the change looks.
- **Never lower a floor or raise a budget to make a test pass.** Fix the corpus, the ranking or the page. If the
  measure itself is wrong, change what it counts and say why in the comment; that has been the right answer four
  times and the wrong one never.

## Rules a test cannot catch

- **An agent works in its own git worktree and never touches another.** Do not copy `node_modules` into one: that
  reached 37 GB across worktrees and filled the disk mid-run. Symlink it, or run the gates from the main checkout.
- **Check the branch you are on before you report it.** Agents have misreported their own branch three times.
- **Exit code 0 is not a commit and "UPLOADED" is not live.** Read the log, check `git log`, and confirm the page
  serves 200 before saying it shipped.
- **Verify on the rendered page, not only in the test.** Reading the live page has caught a gendered pronoun, a
  name printed twice in one sentence, and a budget measuring a quarter of what the reader downloads.
- **Show side-by-side screenshots when opening a product PR.** Capture the same page, viewport and scroll
  position with and without the feature, and put the labelled comparison in the PR description.
- **A fragment in a pattern needs word boundaries.** `imid` matched inside `pyrimidine` and put a myeloma drug's
  blood-clot warning on every fluoropyrimidine page, including one about a skin cream. Six review passes missed it.
- **A full-suite failure under load is usually the machine.** Five whole-page render files (`nested-anchors`,
  `mechanics`, `record-fold`, `record-top`, `EntityDetail`) time out on their own 120-second guard when other
  worktrees are building, and pass alone. Re-run the file before reporting it, and use `SLOW_TEST_MS`, which is
  the env var the chain already sets for this. Do not change a test to make it green.
- **Never resolve a contributor's pull request by union.** `scripts/resolve-additive.py` keeps both sides,
  which is right for an append-only log or a registry line and wrong for an object literal where both sides
  rewrote the same record: on 7 October eleven overlapping pull requests were batch-merged that way and it
  produced TypeScript that would not parse, with two broken files committed before anyone noticed. Merge them
  one at a time and read each hunk. Where an earlier pull request already corrected a record, keep that
  version; where arrays differ, union the arrays so nothing the contributor wrote is lost.
- **The two registry files conflict on every parallel round, and one resolver gets it wrong.**
  `src/data/spikes/index.ts` resolves by union with `scripts/resolve-spike-registry.py`.
  `scripts/spike-sources.ts` holds its map on one very long line, and `scripts/resolve-additive.py` keeps both
  sides of it rather than merging them, which TypeScript rejects as duplicate keys. Merge that line by hand,
  union the entries, and then run `scripts/audit.test.ts`: it is the only thing that notices a lost entry. On
  2 October a hand-merge silently dropped seven files and that test was what caught it.
- **Supplement the record that exists; do not write a second one.** `SpikeSupplement` in
  `src/data/spikes/index.ts` attaches fields to a record another file owns, and the build fails if it names an
  id that does not exist. It is reachable only from a `Spike`, which needs a `cancerId`; for a record with no
  cancer, add to the owning file's own array instead.
- **A question-shaped record name competes with the benchmark questions.** Ask's lexical index scores on
  `name`, so a record called "... and what happened to the survivorship care plan" outranked the right answer
  for the benchmark question "What happened to tazemetostat in 2026?" and dropped extractive recall below its
  floor. Renaming the record fixed it. Name a record for its subject, not as a question.
- **`SCHEMATIC_ALIAS` resolves one hop only.** Aliasing a new technology to an id that is itself an alias
  leaves it on a generic drawing. `src/data/animated-wave8.test.ts` is what catches it; point at the drawing.
- **Grade what is unproven rather than leaving it out.** Where something is widely sold and has no evidence,
  `src/data/complementary.ts` has the model: a tag `evidence:<grade>` from strong to harm, a number only where
  the source states one. A reader who finds nothing here finds the seller's own page instead.
- **Read the smallest page in a round, not the flagship.** That is where a wrongly matched card is visible.
- **Prefer the record that already exists.** A paper is its DOI and its PubMed id; a trial is its registry id. If
  the corpus holds one, supplement it. `npm run dedupe` surveys duplicates before you write.

## The executable truth

Prose drifts; these do not. Read them rather than a description of them.

- `scripts/ship.sh` — the ship chain: gates, commit, push, deploy, then verify the live pages.
- `scripts/resolve-spike-registry.py`, `scripts/resolve-additive.py` — the two merge conflicts every parallel
  round produces, resolved by union.
- `npm run validate` · `typecheck` · `lint` · `vitest run` — the gates. 113 test files encode rules, including
  tone, duplicate records, page cost, red-card matching and search recall.
- `npm run dedupe` · `dedupe:plan` · `dedupe:merge` — duplicate records, with `docs/DUPLICATE-RECORDS.md`.
- `npm run audit:weight` · `audit:mobile` — what a reader actually downloads, and how it reads on a phone.
- `docs/PRODUCT-APPROVAL.md` and `scripts/change-class.ts` — what waits for the owner and what does not.
- `scripts/page-weight.ts --check` and `src/data/page-weight.json` — what a reader downloads, against a ratchet.
  Every other budget in the repo measures static markup, and the hydration payload is 30 to 81 per cent of it.
- `docs/HOUSE-STYLE.md` and `docs/TONE.md` — how to write for this reader. Enforced by `src/lib/tone.test.ts`.
- `docs/CANCER-PAGES.md`, `docs/CANCER-FAMILIES.md`, `docs/DATA-SOURCES.md`, `docs/TABLES.md` — the corpus rules,
  the family roll-up, how to read sources that refuse a script, and the table engine.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to add a record.
