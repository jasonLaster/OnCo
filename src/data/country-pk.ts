  title: "Cancer in Pakistan",
  description:
    "Cancer in Pakistan from Pakistani sources: regional and hospital registries and a 2025 law that makes the National Institutes of Health build a national one, the first pooled report of 269,707 cancers from 2015 to 2019, the health card schemes and what they pay for cancer, the atomic energy commission's chain of cancer hospitals, DRAP's reliance route and price rules, the 2025 HPV vaccine campaign, and the country's first reported CAR-T treatment, at a hospital that makes the cells on site.",
  lede:
    "Pakistan has no national cancer registry yet: its numbers come from regional and hospital registries, seventeen of which a 2025 review identified, and IARC's model puts 2024 at 190,308 new cancers, with breast cancer the commonest; in the pooled count of registered cases, oral cancer is the commonest in men. Much of its cancer care is given by a chain of hospitals run by the atomic energy commission and by charity hospitals, publicly funded health cards pay for inpatient cancer treatment in some provinces, and in July 2026 a military hospital in Rawalpindi that makes CAR-T cells on site for two trials was reported to have given the country's first CAR-T treatment.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 estimate for Pakistan is 190,308 new cancers and 119,742 deaths in 2024, an age-standardised incidence rate of 106.8 per 100,000 and a mortality rate of 69.4. Both are modelled. IARC's fact sheet gives its incidence method as national or subnational rates scaled to regional all-cancer rates, and its mortality method as national incidence estimates applied to model-based mortality-to-incidence ratios from registry survival data, because Pakistan has no national registration of deaths by cause (WHO's 2020 profile records no coverage for 2007 to 2016). IARC's total includes 4,075 non-melanoma skin cancers; without them it is 186,233. No Pakistani source counts the whole country. The pooled national report counted 269,707 registered cases over the five years 2015 to 2019, about 54,000 a year, from six registries most of which are hospital-based: that is a count of people who reached a registering centre, not an incidence estimate, which is why it is far below IARC's figure. The Punjab Cancer Registry's population series for Lahore district from 2010 to 2019, which its authors describe as the first report of cancer statistics over ten years for any region of Pakistan, gives age-standardised rates of 103.4 per 100,000 women and 65.6 per 100,000 men, against IARC's 106.8 for both sexes nationally. Both put breast cancer first: IARC estimates 43,721 new cases, 23% of its total, and the national report found 21.4% of registered cases. The President's World Cancer Day message of February 2026 gives an annual incidence of 185 per 100,000 without naming its source; IARC's 2024 estimate is about 76 per 100,000 before age standardisation.",

In men the commonest was cancer of the mouth, then liver, bowel, lung and prostate. The report's authors note that many of them have known, largely preventable causes.",
          detail:
            "The report, compiled at the Health Research Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Islamabad and published in 2023, pooled the Punjab Cancer Registry, the Karachi Cancer Registry, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission registry, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology registry, Nishtar Medical University Hospital in Multan and Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. 46.7% of cases were in men and 53.61% in women; 45.13% came from Punjab, 26.83% from Sindh, 16.46% from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 3.52% from Balochistan. Breast cancer accounted for 57,633 cases (21.4%). In men the top five were oral (14,477; 11.6%), liver (8,398), colorectal (8,024), lung (7,547) and prostate (7,322); in women breast (56,250; 38.8%), ovary (8,823), oral (7,195), cervix (6,043) and colorectal (4,860). Leukaemia led in children and bone cancer in adolescents. The authors link oral cancer to chewing habits, and liver, lung and cervical cancer to hepatitis B and C, smoking and high-risk human papillomavirus. Because most contributing registries are hospital-based, the shares describe who reached a registering centre, not rates in the population.",

For breast cancer in 2018, only 327 of 8,816 women were diagnosed at stage I. Earlier diagnosis is the change that would most alter what treatment can do.",
          detail:
            "The PAEC Cancer Registry Report for 2018 and 2019 counts 79,254 newly registered patients across 17 Atomic Energy Cancer Hospitals: 6.8% were stage I, 17.1% stage II, 31.0% stage III, 28.5% stage IV, 7.9% unknown and 8.7% cancers with no AJCC stage, such as leukaemias and brain tumours. Its 2018 table for breast cancer (C50) counts 8,816 patients: 327 at stage I, 2,049 at stage II, 3,886 at stage III, 1,818 at stage IV and 736 unstaged, so 44% were stage III and 21% stage IV. For lip, oral cavity and pharynx in 2018, 2,728 of 5,283 patients were stage IV. These are patients at hospitals that see many referred cases, so they may not mirror everyone diagnosed, but no population-based staging data for Pakistan were found. PAEC's next report, for 2020 and 2021 (33,512 and 39,358 patients), says the largest shares of patients were again diagnosed at stage III and IV, as in 2018 and 2019.",

The Karachi Cancer Registry, described as part of the National Cancer Registry, has collected data from eight major hospitals since 2017 and recorded 33,309 malignancies in 2017 to 2019 for Karachi division (16.1 million people), with adult age-standardised rates of 223.6 per 100,000 women and 216.7 per 100,000 men; oral cancer led in adult men and breast cancer in adult women.

State Life, which runs it, lists chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgical oncology among covered services, verified by national identity card at about 1,000 public and private hospitals, with no payment at the point of care. For Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, State Life gives annual cover of up to Rs1,000,000 per family for permanent residents, including cancer treatment, with an outpatient pilot in some districts. In Punjab, Dawn reported (copy of 10 December 2025) that the scheme was closed at all public hospitals from 30 June 2025 and continues only at empanelled private hospitals, in favour of the Chief Minister's own disease programmes.",

        "Some official sources did not answer: the Pakistan Health Research Council's website and the federal health programme's site. The atomic energy commission's pages were read partly from Internet Archive copies; its detailed figures here are mostly for 2018 and 2019, with its 2020 and 2021 report used for totals and the stage pattern.",
      detail:
        "PAEC's medical services page was read from the Internet Archive copy of 25 October 2026 and its 2018 and 2019 registry report from the copy of 12 November 2021; its 2020 and 2021 report, which the Internet Archive does not hold, was downloaded from paec.gov.pk on 4 November 2026. The Pakistan Health Research Council's sites did not answer, so its role, if any, in cancer registration is not described here. There are no national cause-of-death statistics for cancer: WHO's 2020 profile records no coverage of mortality registration, so every death figure for Pakistan is IARC's model. Most official health sources in Pakistan publish in English; the President's World Cancer Day message was read in both its English and Urdu texts, which agree. Pakistani pharmaceutical companies making cancer medicines were not researched for this page.",

    "Incidence for Pakistan is a model: IARC's figures are estimates, and the national registry report counts registered cases, not a population rate. Registry reports for Lahore are preliminary. The health card schemes change by province and by year, and the federal scheme was cleared to run to 30 June 2027; check eligibility by sending your national identity card number to the programme's SMS line or asking the hospital's health facilitation desk. Before relying on the price of a medicine, check DRAP's public price search.",
