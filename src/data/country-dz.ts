  description:
    "Cancer in Algeria from Algerian sources: IARC's estimate of 72,825 new cancers and 37,135 deaths in 2024 against the 51,095 cases the national registry network recorded in 2022, free care in public hospitals and 100% social security cover for cancer, the hospital purchasing body that buys cancer medicines, the ANPP and its 150-day registration rule, an HPV vaccine added for ages 11 to 13 in 2026, radiotherapy waits at the anti-cancer centres, and a presidential cancer commission.",
  lede:
    "Algeria counts cancer through a registry in each wilaya: the national network recorded 51,095 new cancers in 2022, while IARC estimates 72,825 for 2024, with breast, colorectal and lung cancer leading. Care in public hospitals is free by law and social security reimburses cancer care at 100%; the government's own cancer plan named the wait for radiotherapy as the weak point of treatment.",
  globocanNote:
    "IARC's GLOBOCAN 2024 figure for Algeria is 72,825 new cancers and 37,135 deaths, an age-standardised incidence of 153.3 per 100,000 (140.2 in men, 168.9 in women) and mortality of 79.4; the all-cancers figure includes non-melanoma skin cancer, and without it IARC gives 71,500 cases. IARC's fact sheet gives the incidence source as subnational registries, with subnational rates applied to the 2024 population, and mortality as national incidence estimates applied to modelled mortality-to-incidence ratios from registry survival data, so neither number is a count. Algeria's own network of wilaya registries counted 51,095 new cancers in 2022, and the national public health institute's director general reported 56,319 recorded in 2023. Likely reasons for the gap: the registry figures are cases registered in a given year by registries whose national completeness is not published, IARC's figure is a modelled estimate for a later year, and IARC counts skin cancers the registries handle differently. Where a registry measures rates directly the picture can be higher than IARC's national figure: Algiers recorded an age-standardised 173.2 per 100,000 men and 195.9 per 100,000 women in 2022, and breast cancer at 81.9 per 100,000 women against IARC's 69.2. The health minister's figures from the network's October 2026 meeting, 14,712 breast and 4,334 prostate cancers a year, compare with IARC's 17,110 and 3,615, but the report does not say which year they cover.",

Breast cancer is by far the commonest, at more than four in ten cancers in women, followed by colorectal and lung cancer. In men colorectal, lung and prostate cancer lead, and lung cancer causes the most deaths among men.",
          detail:
            "The GLOBOCAN 2024 fact sheet gives 17,110 breast cancers (6,237 deaths), 9,120 colorectal (3,921 deaths), 5,503 lung (4,450 deaths), 3,615 prostate and 3,552 thyroid cancers; cervical cancer is fourth in women at 1,792 cases. In men the leading cancers by cases are colorectum (4,868), lung (4,709), prostate (3,615), bladder (3,040) and stomach (1,800); in women breast (17,110, 42.1% of women's cancers), colorectum (4,252), thyroid (2,956), cervix (1,792) and ovary (1,387). The risk of developing a cancer before age 75 is 15.3% for men and 16.8% for women, and IARC estimates 184,478 people living within five years of a diagnosis. Registry figures tell a similar story with Algerian detail: the 2015 to 2019 national plan reported a median age of 47 for breast cancer, meaning half of breast cancers occurred before that age, and the Algiers registry found the median age at diagnosis in 2022 was 52 for breast cancer and 56 for all cancers in women, against 65 in men.",

The national public health institute (INSP) dates the wilaya registries and their three regional networks to 2015, when the first national indicators were produced. Its Algiers registry, which covered 3.9 million people (8.6% of Algerians) in 2022, collects cases actively from public and private laboratories, cancer centres and hospitals and met the IARC quality criteria in 2022, apart from the share of men's cases known only from a death certificate (6.5% against a limit of 3%). A national registry of cancers in children and adolescents has run since 2018.

Free care was instituted by a presidential ordinance that the 2015 to 2019 national cancer plan places in the period 1973 to 1986. Under articles 300 and 330 of the 2018 law, public hospitals are funded from the state budget, from social security contributions made under contracts with the Ministry of Health, and from other receipts. The plan also records two special accounts for cancer: the fund for emergencies and medical care created in 2002, whose receipts are meant partly for tobacco prevention and tobacco-related illness, which had a balance of about 65.9 billion dinars on 23 October 2014 with no anti-smoking spending yet made, and the cancer control fund created by the 2011 finance law, which pays for screening, training, mobile breast screening units and radiotherapy spare parts. In February 2026 the health minister said radiotherapy maintenance is paid from this cancer account. On 3 May 2026 the President told the Council of Ministers that Algeria provides free care and treatment.",

The CNAS, the fund for salaried workers, explains that its Chifa card carries the patient's entitlement and treatment, and that since 3 February 2013 the third-party payment system works in contracted pharmacies in every wilaya: a chronically ill patient can collect a specific treatment prescribed for up to three months without paying. Two charges can remain: the 20% co-payment for patients covered at 80%, waived for members of a contracted mutual fund, and the difference when a medicine's price is above its reference tariff.

That subsidy rose from 27 billion dinars in 2012 to 50 billion in 2015. Purchases of cancer medicines for oncology and haematology averaged more than 30 billion dinars a year, and oncology purchases in 2014 were 21 billion dinars, more than half for targeted therapy. The plan put its own five-year budget at 178.674 billion dinars, including 66 billion for investment already under way, 2.166 billion for prevention and 1.907 billion for research. A 2025 IHE report commissioned and funded by MSD states that hospital medicines are put on the PCH's list by the Ministry of Health while pharmacy medicines are reimbursed by the health insurance funds, and that 47% of the PCH budget in 2023 went on cancer medicines; OnCo could not check the 47% against a PCH document.

On 5 May 2026 Hamida Kettab of the national federation of cancer patients' associations said waits in Algiers, Blida, Tizi Ouzou and Constantine ran from five to six months and up to a year at some centres such as the CPMC, blamed recurrent breakdowns and maintenance, and said patients were often sent to Adrar, Béchar or El Oued, where waits were sometimes 15 days to a month.
